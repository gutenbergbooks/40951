<h1>JOHNNY LUDLOW.</h1>


<h2>FEATHERSTON&rsquo;S STORY.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>I have called this Featherston&rsquo;s story, because it was
through him that I heard about it&mdash;and, indeed, saw
a little of it towards the end.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buttermead, the wide straggling district to which
Featherston enjoyed the honour of being doctor-in-ordinary,
was as rural as any that can be found in
Worcestershire. Featherston&rsquo;s house stood at the end
of the village. Whitney Hall lay close by; as did
our school, Dr. Frost&rsquo;s. In the neighbourhood were
scattered a few other substantial residences, some
farmers&rsquo; homesteads and labourers&rsquo; cottages. Featherston
was a slim man, with long thin legs and a face
grey and careworn. His patients (like the soldier&rsquo;s
steam arm) gave him no rest day or night.</p>

<p>There is no need to go into details here about
Featherston&rsquo;s people. His sister, Mary Ann, lived in
his house at one time, and for everyday ailments was
almost as good a doctor as he. She was not at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
like him: a merry, talkative, sociable little woman,
with black hair and quick, kindly dark eyes.</p>

<p>Our resident French master in those days at Dr. Frost&rsquo;s
was one Monsieur Jules Carimon: a small
man with honest blue eyes in his clean-shaven face,
and light brown hair cropped close to his head. He
was an awful martinet at study, but a genial little
gentleman out of it. To the surprise of Buttermead,
he and Mary Featherston set up a courtship. It was
carried on in sober fashion, as befitted a sober couple
who had both left thirty years, and the rest, behind
them; and after a summer or two of it they laid
plans for their marriage and for living in France.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what on earth I shall do
amongst the French, Johnny Ludlow,&rdquo; Mary said to
me in her laughing way, when I and Bill Whitney
were having tea at Featherston&rsquo;s one half-holiday, the
week before the wedding. &ldquo;Jules protests they are
easier to get on with than the English; not so stiff
and formal; but I don&rsquo;t pay attention to all he says,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur Jules Carimon was going to settle down
at his native place, Sainteville&mdash;a town on the
opposite coast, which had a service of English steamers
running to it two or three times a-week. He had
obtained the post of first classical master at the college
there, and meant to eke out his salary (never large in
French colleges) by teaching French and mathematics
to as many English pupils as he could obtain out of
hours. Like other northern French seaport towns,
Sainteville had its small colony of British residents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall get on; I am not afraid,&rdquo; answered Mary
Featherston to a doubting remark made to her by old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Mrs. Selby of the Court. &ldquo;Neither I nor Jules have
been accustomed to luxury, and we don&rsquo;t care for
it. We would as soon make our dinner of bread-and-butter
and radishes, as of chicken and apple-tart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the wedding took place, and they departed the
same day for Sainteville. And of the first two or
three years after that there&rsquo;s nothing good or bad to
record.</p>

<p>Selby Court lay just outside Buttermead. Its
mistress, an ancient lady now, was related to the
Preen family, of whom I spoke in that story which
told of the tragical death of Oliver. Lavinia Preen,
sister to Oliver&rsquo;s father, Gervase Preen, but younger,
lived with Mrs. Selby as a sort of adopted daughter;
and when the death of the father, old Mr. Preen, left
nearly all his large family with scarcely any cheese to
their bread, Mrs. Selby told Ann Preen, the youngest
of them all, that she might come to her also. So
Lavinia and Ann Preen lived at the Court, and had no
other home.</p>

<p>These two ladies were intimate with Mary Featherston,
all three being much attached to one another.
When Mary married and left her country for France,
the Miss Preens openly resented it, saying she ought
to have had more consideration. Did some premonitory
instinct prompt that unreasonable resentment?
I cannot say. No one can say. But it is certain that
had Mary Featherston not gone to live abroad, the
ominous chain of events fated to engulf the sisters
could not have touched them, and this account, which
is a perfectly true one, would never have been
written.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>For a short time after the marriage they and Mary
Carimon exchanged a letter now and then; not often,
for foreign postage was expensive; and then it dropped
altogether.</p>

<p>Mrs. Selby became an invalid, and died. She left
each of the two sisters seventy pounds a-year for life;
if the one died, the other was to enjoy the whole;
when both were dead, it would lapse back to the Selby
estate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seventy pounds a-year!&rdquo; remarked Ann Preen
to her sister. &ldquo;It does not seem very much, does it,
Lavinia? Shall we be able to live upon it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were seated in the wainscoted parlour at
Selby Court, talking of the future. The funeral was
over, and they must soon leave; for the house was
waiting to be done up for the reception of its new
master, Mr. Paul Selby, an old bachelor full of nervous
fancies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must live upon it, Nancy,&rdquo; said Lavinia in
answer to her.</p>

<p>She was the stronger-minded of the two, and she
looked it. A keen, practical woman, of rather more
than middle height, with smooth brown hair, pleasant,
dark hazel eyes, and a bright glow in her cheeks.
Ann (or Nancy, as she was more often called) was
smaller and lighter, with a pretty face, a shower of
fair ringlets, and mild, light-blue eyes; altogether not
unlike a pink-and-white wax doll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should have been worse off, Nancy, had she
not left us anything; and sometimes I have feared
she might not,&rdquo; remarked Lavinia cheerfully. &ldquo;It will
be a hundred and forty pounds between us, dear; we
can live upon that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we can, if you think so, Lavinia,&rdquo; said
the other, who deemed her elder sister wiser than any
one in the world, and revered her accordingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we should live cheaper abroad than here, I
expect,&rdquo; continued Lavinia. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s said money goes
twice as far in France as in England. Suppose we
were to go over, Nancy, and try? We could come
back if we did not like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy&rsquo;s eyes sparkled. &ldquo;I think it would be
delightful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Money go further in France&mdash;why,
to be sure it does! Aunt Emily is able to live
like a princess at Tours, by all accounts. Yes, yes,
Lavinia, let us try France!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One fine spring morning the Miss Preens packed up
their bag and baggage and started for the Continent.
They went direct to Tours, intending to make that
place their pied-à-terre, as the French phrase it; at
any rate, for a time. It was not, perhaps, the wisest
thing they could have done.</p>

<p>For Mrs. Magnus, formerly Emily Preen, and their
late father&rsquo;s sister, did not welcome them warmly.
She lived in style herself, one of the leading stars in
the society of Tours; and she did not at all like that
two middle-aged nieces, of straitened means, should
take up their abode in the next street. So Mrs.
Magnus met her nieces with the assurance that Tours
would not do for them; it was too expensive a place;
they would be swamped in it. Mrs. Magnus was
drawing near to the close of her life then; had she
known it, she might have been kinder, and let them
remain; but she was not able to foresee the hour of
that great event which must happen to us all any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
more than other people are. Oliver Preen was with
her then, revelling in the sunny days which were
flitting away on gossamer wings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lavinia, do you think we can stay at Tours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Miss Preens had descended at a fourth-rate
hotel, picked out of the guide-book. When Ann asked
this question, they were sitting after dinner in the
table d&rsquo;hôte room, their feet on the sanded floor.
Sanded floors were quite usual at that time in many
parts of France.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay here to put up with Aunt Emily&rsquo;s pride and
insolence!&rdquo; quickly answered Miss Preen. &ldquo;No. I
will tell you what I have done, Ann. I wrote yesterday
to Mary Carimon, asking her about Sainteville;
whether she thinks it will suit us, and so on. As
soon as her answer comes&mdash;she&rsquo;s certain to say yes&mdash;we
will <em>go</em>, dear, and leave Mrs. Magnus to her
grandeur. And, once we are safe away, <em>I shall write
her a letter</em>,&rdquo; added Lavinia, in decisive tones; &ldquo;a
letter which she won&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Carimon&rsquo;s answer came by return of post.
It was as cordial as herself. Sainteville would be the
very place for them, she said, and she should count
the hours until they were there.</p>

<p>The Miss Preens turned their backs upon Tours,
shaking its dust off their shoes. Lavinia had a little
nest of accumulated money, so was at ease in that
respect. And when the evening of the following day
the railway terminus at Sainteville was reached, the
pleasant, smiling face of Mary Carimon was the first
they saw outside the barrière. She must have been
nearly forty now, but she did not look a day older
than when she had left Buttermead. Miss Lavinia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
was a year or two older than Mary; Miss Ann a year
or two younger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must put up at the Hôtel des Princes,&rdquo; remarked
Madame Carimon. &ldquo;It is the only really good
one in the town. They won&rsquo;t charge you too much;
my husband has spoken to the landlady. And you
must spend to-morrow with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hotel omnibus was waiting for them and other
passengers, the luggage was piled on the roof, and
Madame Carimon accompanied them to the hotel. A
handsome hotel, the sisters thought; quite another
thing from the one at Tours. Mary Carimon introduced
them to the landlady, Madame Podevin, saw
them seated down to tea and a cold fowl, and then
left for the night.</p>

<p>With Sainteville the Miss Preens were simply
charmed. It was a fresh, clean town, with wide
streets, and good houses and old families, and some
bright shops. The harbour was large, and the pier
extended out to the open sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>should</em> like to live here!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
Lavinia, sitting down at Madame Carimon&rsquo;s, in a state
of rapture. &ldquo;I never saw such a nice town, or such a
lovely market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had been about all the morning with Madame
Carimon. It was market-day, Wednesday. The
market was held on the Grande Place; and the
delicious butter, the eggs, the fresh vegetables, the
flowers and the poultry, took Miss Lavinia&rsquo;s heart by
storm. Nancy was more taken with the picturesque
market-women, in their white caps and long gold ear-rings.
Other ladies were doing their marketing as
well as Madame Carimon. She spoke to most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
them, in French or in English, as the case might be.
Under the able tuition of her husband, she talked
French fluently now.</p>

<p>Madame Carimon&rsquo;s habitation&mdash;very nice, small and
compact&mdash;was in the Rue Pomme Cuite. The streets
have queer names in some of these old French towns.
It was near the college, which was convenient for
Monsieur Carimon. Here they lived, with their
elderly servant, Pauline. The same routine went on
daily in the steady little domicile from year&rsquo;s end to
year&rsquo;s end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jules goes to the college at eight o&rsquo;clock every
week-day, after a cup of coffee and a petit pain,&rdquo; said
madame to her guests, &ldquo;and he returns at five to
dinner. He takes his déjeûner in the college at
twelve, and I take mine alone at home. On Sundays
he has no duty: we attend the French Protestant
Church in a morning, dine at one o&rsquo;clock, and go for a
walk in the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no children, Mary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Carimon&rsquo;s lively face turned sad as she
answered: &ldquo;There was one little one; she stayed
with us six months, and then God took her. I wrote
to you of it, you know, Lavinia. No, we have not any
children. Best not, Jules says; and I agree with him.
They might only leave us when we have learnt to love
them; and that&rsquo;s a trial hard to bear. Best as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I should never learn to speak French,
though we lived here for a century,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
Lavinia. &ldquo;Only to hear you jabbering to your servant,
Mary, quite distracts one&rsquo;s ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you would. You would soon pick up enough
to be understood in the shops and at market.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>At five o&rsquo;clock, home came Monsieur Carimon. He
welcomed the Miss Preens with honest, genuine
pleasure, interspersed with a little French ceremony;
making them about a dozen bows apiece before he
met the hands held out to him.</p>

<p>They had quite a gala dinner. Soup to begin with&mdash;broth,
the English ladies inwardly pronounced it&mdash;and
then fish. A small cod, bought by Madame
Carimon at the fish-market in the morning, with
oyster sauce. Ten sous she had given for the cod, for
she knew how to bargain now, and six sous for a
dozen oysters, as large as a five-franc piece. This was
followed by a delicious little fricandeau of veal, and
that by a tarte à la crême from the pastrycook&rsquo;s. She
told her guests unreservedly what all the dishes cost,
to show them how reasonably people might live at
Sainteville.</p>

<p>Over the coffee, after dinner, the question of their
settling in the place was fully gone into, for the
benefit of Monsieur Carimon&rsquo;s opinions, who gave
them in good English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, Lavinia, you could not do better,&rdquo;
remarked Mary Carimon. &ldquo;If you cannot make your
income do here, you cannot anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to make it do well; not to betray our
poverty, but to be able to maintain a fairly good
appearance,&rdquo; said Lavinia. &ldquo;You understand me, I
am sure, monsieur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But certainly, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;it
is what we all like to do at Sainteville, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And <em>can</em> do, if we are provident,&rdquo; added madame.
&ldquo;French ways are not English ways. Our own income
is small, Lavinia, yet we put by out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A fact that goes without saying,&rdquo; confirmed the
pleasant little man. &ldquo;If we did not put by, where
would my wife be when I am no longer able to
work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Provisions being so cheap&mdash;&mdash; What did you
say, Nancy?&rdquo; asked Madame Carimon, interrupting
herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to say that I could live upon oysters,
and should like to,&rdquo; replied Nancy, shaking back her
flaxen curls with a laugh. &ldquo;Half-a-dozen of those
great big oysters would make me a lovely dinner any
day&mdash;and the cost would be only three halfpence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And only fivepence the cost of that beautiful fish,&rdquo;
put in her sister. &ldquo;In Sainteville our income would
amply suffice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that it would, mesdemoiselles,&rdquo;
observed Monsieur Carimon. &ldquo;Three thousand five
hundred francs yearly! We French should think it a
sufficient sum. Doubtless much would depend upon
the way in which you laid it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should we have to pay for lodgings, Mary?&rdquo;
inquired Lavinia. &ldquo;Just a nice sitting-room and two
small bedrooms; or a large room with two beds in it;
and to be waited on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you won&rsquo;t find that at Sainteville,&rdquo; was the
unexpected answer. &ldquo;Nobody lets lodgings English
fashion: it&rsquo;s not the custom over here. You can find
a furnished apartment, but the people will not wait
upon you. There is always a little kitchen let with
the rooms, and you must have your own servant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the first check the ladies had received. They
sat thinking. &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; exclaimed Nancy. &ldquo;No
lodgings!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Would the apartments you speak of be very
dear?&rdquo; asked Lavinia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends upon the number of rooms and
the situation,&rdquo; replied Madame Carimon. &ldquo;I cannot
call to mind just now any small apartment that is
vacant. If you like, we will go to-morrow and look
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was so arranged. And little Monsieur Carimon
attended the ladies back to the Hôtel des Princes at
the sober hour of nine, and bowed them into the porte
cochère with two sweeps of his hat, wishing them the
good-evening and the very good-night.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Thursday morning. Nancy Preen awoke with a
sick headache, and could not get up. But in the
afternoon, when she was better, they went to Mary
Carimon&rsquo;s, and all three set out to look for an apartment&mdash;not
meeting with great success.</p>

<p>All they saw were too large, and priced accordingly.
There was one, indeed, in the Rue Lamartine, which
suited as to size, but the rooms were inconvenient and
stuffy; and there was another small one on the Grande
Place, dainty and desirable, but the rent was very
high. Madame Carimon at once offered the landlord
half-price, French custom: she dealt at his shop for
her groceries. No, no, he answered; his apartment
was the nicest in the town for its size, as mesdames
saw, and it was in the best situation&mdash;and not a single
sou would the worthy grocer abate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>They were growing tired, then; and five o&rsquo;clock,
the universal hour at Sainteville for dinner, was
approaching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come round to me after dinner, and we will talk
it over,&rdquo; said Mary Carimon, when they parted. &ldquo;I
will give you a cup of tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They dined at the table d&rsquo;hôte, which both of them
thought charming, and then proceeded to the Rue
Pomme Cuite. Monsieur Carimon was on the point of
going out, to spend an hour at the Café Pillaud, but
he put down his hat to wait awhile, out of respect to
the ladies. They told him about not having found an
apartment to suit them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we have not searched all parts of the
town, only the most likely ones,&rdquo; said Madame
Carimon. &ldquo;There are large apartments to be had,
but no small ones. We can search again to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s not a little house to be had
cheap, if we cannot find an apartment?&rdquo; cried Miss
Nancy, who was in love with Sainteville, and had set
her heart upon remaining there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tiens,&rdquo; quickly spoke Monsieur Carimon in French
to his wife, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the Petite Maison Rouge belonging
to Madame Veuve Sauvage, in the Place Ronde. It
is still to let: I saw the affiche in the shop window
to-day. What do you think of it, Marie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Carimon did not seem to know quite what
to think. She looked at her husband, then at the
eager faces of her two friends; but she did not speak.</p>

<p>About half-way down the Rue Tessin, a busy street
leading to the port, was a wide opening, giving on to
the Place Ronde. The Place Ronde agreed with its
name, for it was somewhat in form of a horseshoe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Some fifteen or sixteen substantial houses were built
round it, each having a shop for its basement; and
trees, green and feathery, were scattered about, affording
a slight though pleasant shelter from the hot sun
in summer weather.</p>

<p>The middle house at the bottom of the Place Ronde,
exactly facing the opening from the Rue Tessin, was a
very conspicuous house indeed, inasmuch as it was
painted red, whilst the other houses were white. All
of them had green persienne shutters to the upper
windows. The shop, a large one, belonging to this
red house was that of the late Monsieur Jean Sauvage,
&ldquo;Marchand de Vin en gros et en détail,&rdquo; as the
announcement over his door used to run in the later
years of his life. But when Jean Sauvage commenced
business, in that same shop, it was only as a retail
vendor. Casting about in his mind one day for some
means by which his shop might be distinguished from
other wine-shops and attract customers, he hit upon
the plan of painting the house red. No sooner thought
of than done. A painter was called, who converted
the white walls into a fiery vermilion, and stretched a
board across the upper part, between the windows of
the first and second floors, on which appeared in large
letters &ldquo;A la Maison Rouge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether this sort of advertisement drew the public,
or whether it might have been the sterling respectability
and devotion to business of Monsieur Sauvage, he got
on most successfully. The Marchand en détail became
also Marchand en gros, and in course of time he added
liqueurs to his wines. No citizen of Sainteville was
more highly esteemed than he, both as a man and a
tradesman. Since his death the business had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
carried on by his widow, aided by the two sons,
Gustave and Emile. Latterly Madame Veuve Sauvage
had given up all work to them; she was now in years,
and had well earned her rest. They lived in the
rooms over the shop, which were large and handsome.
In former days, when the energies of herself and her
husband were chiefly devoted to acquiring and saving
money, they had let these upper rooms for a good sum
yearly. Old Madame Sauvage might be seen any
day now sitting at a front-window, looking out
upon the world between her embroidered white
curtains.</p>

<p>The door of this prosperous shop was between the
two windows. The one window displayed a few
bottles of wine, most of them in straw cases; in the
other window were clear flacons of liqueurs: chartreuse,
green and yellow; curaçoa, warm and ruby; eau de
vie de Danzick, with its fluttering gold leaf; and
many other sorts.</p>

<p>However, it is not with the goods of Madame Veuve
Sauvage that we have to do, but with her premises.
Standing in front of the shop, as if coveting a bottle
of that choice wine for to-day&rsquo;s dinner, or an immediate
glass of delicious liqueur, you may see on your
right hand, but to the left of the shop, the private
door of the house. On the other side the shop is also
a door which opens to a narrow entry. The entry
looks dark, even in the mid-day sun, for it is pretty
long, extending down a portion of the side of the
Maison Rouge, which is a deep house, and terminating
in a paved yard surrounded by high buildings. At
the end of the yard is a small dwelling, with two
modern windows, one above the other. Near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
under window is the entrance-door, painted oak
colour, with a brass knob, a bell-wire with a curious
handle, and a knocker. This little house the late
Monsieur Sauvage had also caused to be converted
into a red one, the same as the larger.</p>

<p>In earlier days, when Jean Sauvage and his wife
were putting their shoulders to the wheel, they had
lived in the little house with their children; the two
sons and the daughter, Jeanne. Jeanne Sauvage
married early and very well, an avocat. But since
they had left it, the house in the yard seemed to
have been, as the Widow Sauvage herself expressed
it, unlucky. The first of the tenants had died
there; the second had disappeared&mdash;decamped in
fact, to avoid paying rent and other debts; the
third had moved into a better house; and the
fourth, an old widow lady, had also died, owing a
year&rsquo;s rent to Madame Sauvage, and leaving no money
to pay it.</p>

<p>It was of this small dwelling, lying under the
shadow of the Maison Rouge, that Monsieur Carimon
had thought. Turning to the Miss Preens, he gave
them briefly a few particulars, and said he believed
the house was to be had on very reasonable terms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you call it?&rdquo; exclaimed Lavinia. &ldquo;The
little red house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we call it so,&rdquo; said Monsieur Carimon.
&ldquo;Emile Sauvage was talking of it to me the other
evening at the café, saying they would be glad to
have it tenanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear our good friends here would find it dull,&rdquo;
remarked Madame Carimon to him. &ldquo;It is in so
gloomy a situation, you know, Jules.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mon amie, I do not myself see how that signifies,&rdquo;
said he in reply. &ldquo;If your house is comfortable inside,
does it matter what it looks out upon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; assented Miss Lavinia, whose hopes
had gone up again. &ldquo;But this house may not be
furnished, Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is partly furnished,&rdquo; said Madame Carimon.
&ldquo;When the old lady who was last in it died, they had
to take her furniture for the rent. It was not much,
I have heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should not want much, only two of us,&rdquo; cried
Miss Ann eagerly. &ldquo;Do let us go to look at it to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the following day, Friday, the Miss Preens went
to the Place Ronde, piloted by Mary Carimon. They
were struck with admiration at the Maison Rouge, all
a fiery glow in the morning sun, and a novelty to
English eyes. Whilst Madame Carimon went into the
shop to explain and ask for the key, the sisters gazed
in at the windows. Lying on the wine-bottles was
a small black board on which was written in white
letters, &ldquo;Petite Maison à louer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur Gustave Sauvage, key in hand, saluted the
ladies in English, which he spoke fairly well, and accompanied
them to view the house. The sun was very
bright that day, and the confined yard did not look so
dull as at a less favourable time; and perhaps the
brilliant red of the little house, at which Nancy
laughed, imparted a cheerfulness to it. Monsieur
Gustave opened the door with a latch-key, drew back,
and waited for them to enter.</p>

<p>The first to do so, or to attempt to do so, was Miss
Preen. But no sooner had she put one foot over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
threshold than she drew back with a start, somewhat
discomposing the others by the movement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Lavinia?&rdquo; inquired Ann.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something seemed to startle me, and throw me
backward!&rdquo; exclaimed Lavinia Preen, regaining her
breath. &ldquo;Perhaps it was the gloom of the passage:
it is very dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, mesdames,&rdquo; spoke Monsieur Gustave
politely. &ldquo;If the ladies will forgive my entering
before them, I will open the salon door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The passage was narrow. The broad shoulders of
Monsieur Gustave almost touched the wall on either
side as he walked along. Almost at the other end of
it, on his left hand, was the salon door; he threw it
open, and a little light shone forth. The passage
terminated in a small square recess. At the back of
this was fixed a shallow marble slab for holding things,
above which was a cupboard let into the wall. On
the right of the recess was the staircase; and opposite
the staircase the kitchen-door, the kitchen being behind
the salon.</p>

<p>The salon was nice when they were in it; the
paint was fresh, the paper light and handsome. It
was of good size, and its large window looked to the
front. The kitchen opened upon a small back-yard,
furnished with a pump and a shed for wood or coal.
On the floor above were two very good chambers, one
behind the other. Opposite these, on the other side of
the passage, was another room, not so large, but of
fair size. It was apparently built out over some part
of the next-door premises, and was lighted by a skylight.
All the rooms were fresh and good, and the
passage had a window at the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Altogether it was not an inconvenient abode for
people who did not go in for show. The furniture
was plain, clean and useful, but it would have to be
added to. There were no grates, not even a cooking-stove
in the kitchen. It was very much the Sainteville
custom at that period for tenants to provide grates for
themselves, plenty of which could be bought or hired
for a small sum. An easy-chair or two would be
needed; tea-cups and saucers and wine-glasses; and
though, there were washing-stands, these contained no
jugs or basins; and there were no sheets or tablecloths
or towels, no knives or forks, no brooms or
brushes, and so on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is only this one sitting-room, you perceive,&rdquo;
remarked Madame Carimon, as they turned about,
looking at the salon again, after coming downstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s a pity, on account of dining,&rdquo; replied
Miss Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of our tenants made a pretty salon of the
room above this, and this the salle à manger,&rdquo; replied
Monsieur Gustave. &ldquo;Mesdames might like to do the
same, possibly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had pointedly addressed Miss Lavinia, near
whom he stood. She did not answer. In fact&mdash;it was
a very curious thing, but a fact&mdash;Miss Lavinia had not
spoken a word since she entered. She had gone
through the house taking in its features in complete
silence, just as if that shock at the door had scared
away her speech.</p>

<p>The rent asked by Monsieur Gustave, acting for his
mother, was very moderate indeed&mdash;twenty pounds
a-year, including the use of the furniture. There
would be no taxes to pay, he said; absolutely none;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the taxes of this little house, being upon their premises,
were included in their own. But to ensure this low
rental, the house must be taken for five years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we will take it&mdash;won&rsquo;t we, Lavinia?&rdquo;
cried Miss Ann in a loud whisper. &ldquo;<em>Only</em> twenty
pounds a-year! Just think of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; Miss Lavinia said to Monsieur Gustave,
speaking at last, &ldquo;the house would suit us in some
respects, especially as regards rent. But we might
find it too lonely: and I should hardly like to be
bound for five years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All that was of course for mesdames&rsquo; consideration,
he frankly responded. But he thought that if the
ladies were established in it with their ménage about
them, they would not find it lonely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will give you an answer to-morrow or Monday,&rdquo;
decided Miss Lavinia.</p>

<p>They went about the town all that day with
Madame Carimon; but nothing in the shape of an
apartment could be found to suit them. Madame
invited them again to tea in the evening. And by
that time they had decided to take the house. Nancy
was wild about it. What with the change from the
monotony of their country house to the bright and
busy streets, the gay outdoor life, the delights of the
table d&rsquo;hôte, Ann Preen looked upon Sainteville as an
earthly paradise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house is certainly more suited to you than
anything else we have seen,&rdquo; observed Madame Carimon.
&ldquo;I have nothing to say against the Petite
Maison Rouge, except its dull situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did it strike you, Mary, apart from its situation, as
being gloomy?&rdquo; asked Lavinia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Once you are in the rooms they are cheerful
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It did me. Gloomy, with a peculiar gloom, you
understand. I&rsquo;m sure the passage was dark as night.
It must have been its darkness that startled me as we
were going in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, Lavinia, what was the matter with
you then?&rdquo; interrupted her sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Nancy; I said at the time I did
not know. With my first step into the passage,
some horror seemed to meet me and drive me backward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some horror!&rdquo; repeated Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seemed to feel it so. I had still the glare of the
streets and the fiery red walls in my eyes, which must
have caused the house passage to look darker than it
ought. That was all, I suppose&mdash;but it turned me sick
with a sort of fear; sick and shivery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That salon may be made as pretty a room as any
in Sainteville,&rdquo; remarked Madame Carimon. &ldquo;Many
of the English residents here have only one salon in
their apartments. You see, we don&rsquo;t go in for
ceremony; France is not like England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the morrow the little house under the wing of
the Maison Rouge was secured by the Miss Preens.
They took it in their joint names for five years. To
complete the transaction they were ushered upstairs
to the salon and presence of Madame Veuve Sauvage&mdash;a
rather stately looking old lady, attired in a
voluminous black silk robe and a mourning cap of fine
muslin. Madame, who could not speak a syllable of
English, conversed graciously with her future tenants
through the interpretation of Mary Carimon, offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to be useful to them in any way she could. Lavinia
and Ann Preen both signed the bail, or agreement,
and Madame Veuve Sauvage likewise signed it; by
virtue of which she became their landlady, and they
her tenants of the little house for five years. Madame
Carimon, and a shopman who came upstairs for the
purpose, signed as witnesses.</p>

<p>Wine and the little cakes called pistolets were then
introduced; and so the bargain was complete.</p>

<p>Oh if some kindly spirit from the all-seeing world
above could only have whispered a hint to those ill-fated
sisters of what they were doing!&mdash;had only
whispered a warning in time to prevent it! Might
not that horror, which fell upon Lavinia as she was
about to pass over the door-sill, have served her as
such? But who regards these warnings when they
come to us? Who personally applies them? None.</p>

<p>Having purchased or hired the additional things
required, the Miss Preens took possession of their
house. Nancy had the front bed-chamber, which
Lavinia thought rather the best, and so gave it up to
her; Lavinia took the back one. The one opposite,
with the skylight, remained unoccupied, as their
servant did not sleep in the house. Not at all an
uncommon custom at Sainteville.</p>

<p>An excellent servant had been found for them in the
person of Flore Pamart, a widow, who was honest,
cooked well, and could talk away in English; all
recommendations that the ladies liked. Flore let herself
in with a latch-key before breakfast, and left
as soon after five o&rsquo;clock in the evening as she could
get the dinner things removed. Madame Flore
Pamart had one little boy named Dion, who went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
school by day, but was at home night and morning;
for which reason his mother could only take a daily
service.</p>

<p>Thus the Miss Preens became part of the small
colony of English at Sainteville. They took sittings
in the English Protestant Church, which was not
much more than a room; and they subscribed to the
casino on the port when it opened for the summer
season, spending many an evening there, listening to
the music, watching the dancing when there was any,
and chattering with the acquaintances they met.
They were well regarded, these new-comers, and they
began to speak French after a fashion. Now and then
they went out to a soirée; once in a way gave one in
return. Very sober soirées indeed were those of Sainteville;
consisting (as Sam Weller might inform us) of
tea at seven o&rsquo;clock with, hot galette, conversation,
cake at ten (gâteau Suisse or gâteau au rhum), and
a glass of Picardin wine.</p>

<p>They were pleased with the house, once they had
settled down in it, and never a shadow of regret
crossed either of them for having taken the Petite
Maison Rouge.</p>

<p>In this way about a twelvemonth wore on.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>It was a fine morning at the beginning of April; the
sun being particularly welcome, as Sainteville had
latterly been favoured with a spell of ill-natured, bitter
east winds. About eleven o&rsquo;clock, Miss Preen and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
sister turned out of their house to take a walk on the
pier&mdash;which they liked to do most days, wind and
weather permitting. In going down the Rue des
Arbres, they were met by a fresh-looking little elderly
gentleman, with rather long white hair, and wearing
a white necktie. He stopped to salute the ladies,
bowing ceremoniously low to each of them. It was
Monsieur le Docteur Dupuis, a kindly man of skilful
reputation, who had now mostly, though not altogether,
given up practice to his son, Monsieur Henri Dupuis.
Miss Lavinia had a little acquaintance with the doctor,
and took occasion to ask him news of the public
welfare; for there was raging in the town the malady
called &ldquo;la grippe,&rdquo; which, being interpreted, means
influenza.</p>

<p>It was not much better at present, Monsieur Dupuis
answered; but this genial sunshine he hoped would
begin to drive it away; and, with another bow, he
passed onward.</p>

<p>The pier was soon reached, and they enjoyed their
walk upon it. The sunlight glinted on the rather
turbulent waves of the sea in the distance, but there
was not much breeze to be felt on land. When nearing
the end of the pier their attention was attracted to a
fishing-boat, which was tumbling about rather unaccountably
in its efforts to make the harbour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It almost looks from here as though it had lost its
rudder, Nancy,&rdquo; remarked Miss Lavinia.</p>

<p>They halted, and stood looking over the side at
the object of interest; not particularly noticing that
a gentleman stood near them, also looking at the same
through an opera-glass. He was spare, of middle
height and middle age; his hair was grey, his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
pale and impassive; the light over-coat he wore was
of fashionable English cut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lavinia, look, look! It is coming right on to
the end of the pier,&rdquo; cried Ann Preen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Nancy, don&rsquo;t excite yourself,&rdquo; said Miss
Lavinia, in lowered tones. &ldquo;It will take care not to
do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman gave a wary glance at them. He
saw two ladies dressed alike, in handsome black
velvet mantles, and bonnets with violet feathers;
by which he judged them to be sisters, though there
was no resemblance in face. The elder had clear-cut
features, a healthy colour, dark brown hair, worn
plain, and a keen, sensible expression. The other
was fair, with blue eyes and light ringlets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he said, turning to them, and his
accent was that of a gentleman. &ldquo;May I offer you
the use of my glasses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; exclaimed Nancy, in a light
tone bordering on a giggle; and she accepted the
glasses. She was evidently pleased with the offer
and with the stranger.</p>

<p>Lavinia, on the contrary, was not. The moment
she saw his full face she shrank from it&mdash;shrank from
him. The feeling might have been as unaccountable
as that which came over her when she had been first
entering the Petite Maison Rouge; but it was there.
However, she put it from her, and thanked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I see so well with the glasses as
without them; it seems all a mist,&rdquo; remarked Nancy,
who was standing next the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not properly focused for you. Allow
me,&rdquo; said he, as he took the glasses from her to alter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
them. &ldquo;Young eyes need a less powerful focus than
elderly ones like mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke in a laughing tone; Nancy, fond of
compliments, giggled outright this time. She was
approaching forty; he might have been ten years
older. They continued standing there, watching the
fishing-boat, and exchanging remarks at intervals.
When it had made the harbour without accident, the
Miss Preens wished him good-morning, and went back
down the pier; he took off his hat to them, and
walked the other way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a <em>charming</em> man!&rdquo; exclaimed Nancy, when
they were at a safe distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; dissented Lavinia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not like him!&rdquo; echoed the other in surprise.
&ldquo;Why, Lavinia, his manners are delightful. I wonder
who he is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When nearly home, in turning into the Place
Ronde, they met an English lady of their acquaintance,
the wife of Major Smith. She had been ordering
a dozen of vin Picardin from the Maison Rouge.
As they stood talking together, the gentleman of the
pier passed up the Rue de Tessin. He lifted his hat,
and they all, including Mrs. Smith, bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo; quickly asked Nancy, in a
whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly that,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Smith. &ldquo;When we
were passing the Hôtel des Princes this morning, a
gentleman turned out of the courtyard, and he and
my husband spoke to one another. The major said
to me afterwards that he had formerly been in the&mdash;I
forget which&mdash;regiment. He called him Mr.
Fennel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, as ill-fortune had it, Miss Preen found herself
very poorly after she got home. She began to sneeze
and cough, and thought she must have taken cold
through standing on the pier to watch the vagaries
of the fishing-smack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you are not going to have the influenza!&rdquo;
cried Nancy, her blue eyes wide with concern.</p>

<p>But the influenza it proved to be. Miss Preen
seemed about to have it badly, and lay in bed the
next day. Nancy proposed to send Flore for Monsieur
Dupuis, but Lavinia said she knew how to treat
herself as well as he could treat her.</p>

<p>The next day she was no better. Poor Nancy had
to go out alone, or to stay indoors. She did not like
doing the latter at all; it was too dull; her own
inclination would have led her abroad all day long
and every day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw Captain Fennel on the pier again,&rdquo; said
she to her sister that afternoon, when she was making
the tea at Lavinia&rsquo;s bedside, Flore having carried up
the tray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you did not talk to him, Ann,&rdquo; spoke the
invalid, as well as she could articulate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I talked a little,&rdquo; said Nancy, turning hot, conscious
that she had gossiped with him for three-quarters-of-an-hour.
&ldquo;He stopped to speak to me; I
could not walk on rudely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any way, don&rsquo;t talk to him again, my dear. I do
not like that man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is there to dislike in him, Lavinia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t say. His countenance is not a good
one; it is shifty and deceitful. He is a man you
could never trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve heard you say the same of other
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I can read faces,&rdquo; returned Lavinia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;well&mdash;I consider Captain Fennel&rsquo;s is a <em>handsome</em>
face,&rdquo; debated Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you call him &lsquo;Captain&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He calls himself so,&rdquo; answered Nancy. &ldquo;I suppose
it was his rank in the army when he retired. They
retain it afterwards by courtesy, don&rsquo;t they, Lavinia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure. It depends upon whether they
retire in rotation or sell out, I fancy. Mrs. Smith
said the major called him Mr. Fennel, and he ought
to know. There, I can&rsquo;t talk any more, Nancy, and
the man is nothing to us, that we need discuss him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>La grippe had taken rather sharp hold of Lavinia
Preen, and she was upstairs for ten days. On the
first afternoon she went down to the salon, Captain
Fennel called, very much to her surprise; and, also to
her surprise, he and Nancy appeared to be pretty
intimate.</p>

<p>In point of fact, they had met every day, generally
upon the pier. Nancy had said nothing about it at
home. She was neither sly nor deceitful in disposition;
rather notably simple and unsophisticated; but, after
Lavinia&rsquo;s reproof the first time she told about meeting
him, she would not tell again.</p>

<p>Miss Preen behaved coolly to him; which he would
not appear to see. She sat over the fire, wrapped
in a shawl, for it was a cold afternoon. He stayed
only a little time, and put his card down on the slab
near the stairs when he left. Lavinia had it brought
to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Edwin Fennel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he is not Captain Fennel,&rdquo; she observed.
&ldquo;But, Nancy, what in the world could have induced
the man to call here? And how is it you seem to be
familiar with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have met him out-of-doors, sometimes, while you
were ill,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;As to his calling here&mdash;he
came, I suppose, out of politeness. There&rsquo;s no harm
in it, Lavinia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Lavinia did not say there was. But she disliked
the man too much to favour his acquaintanceship.
Instinct warned her against him.</p>

<p>How little was she prepared for what was to follow!
Before she was well out-of-doors again, before she had
been anywhere except to church, Nancy gave her
a shock. With no end of simperings and blushings,
she confessed that she had been asked to marry
Captain Fennel.</p>

<p>Had Miss Lavinia Preen been herself politely asked
to marry a certain gentleman popularly supposed to
reside underground, she would not have been much
more indignantly startled. Perhaps &ldquo;frightened&rdquo;
would be the better word for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;you <em>would</em> not, Nancy!&rdquo; she gasped, when
she found her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; simpered foolish Nancy. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;think
him very nice and gentlemanly, Lavinia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia came out of her fright sufficiently to reason.
She strove to show Nancy how utterly unwise such a
step would be. They knew nothing of Captain Fennel
or his antecedents; to become his wife might just be
courting misery and destruction. Nancy ceased to
argue; and Lavinia hoped she had yielded.</p>

<p>Both sisters kept a diary. But for that fact, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
also that the diaries were preserved, Featherston could
not have arrived at the details of the story so perfectly.
About this time, a trifle earlier or later, Ann Preen
wrote as follows in hers:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>April 16th.</i>&mdash;I met Captain Fennel on the pier
again this morning. I do <em>think</em> he goes there because
he knows he may meet me. Lavinia is not out yet;
she has not quite got rid of that Grip, as they stupidly
call it here. I&rsquo;m sure it has gripped <em>her</em>. We walked
quite to the end of the pier, and then I sat down on
the edge for a little while, and he stood talking to me.
I do wish I could tell Lavinia of these meetings; but
she was so cross the first day I met him, and told her
of it, that I don&rsquo;t like to. Captain Fennel lent me his
glasses as usual, and I looked at the London steamer,
which was coming in. Somehow we fell to talking of
the Smiths; he said they were poor, had not much
more than the major&rsquo;s half-pay. &lsquo;Not like you rich
people, Miss Nancy,&rsquo; he said&mdash;he thinks that&rsquo;s my
right name. &lsquo;Your income is different from theirs.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; I screamed out, &lsquo;why, it&rsquo;s only a hundred and
forty pounds a-year!&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he answered, smiling,
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s a comfortable sum for a place like this; five
francs will buy as much at Sainteville as half-a-sovereign
will in England.&rsquo; Which is pretty nearly
true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Skipping a few entries of little importance, we come
to another:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>May 1st</i>, and such a lovely day!&mdash;It reminds me
of one May-day at home, when the Jacks-in-the-green
were dancing on the grass-plot before the Court
windows at Buttermead, and Mrs. Selby sat watching
them, as pleased as they were, saying she should like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to dance, too, if she could only go first to the mill to
be ground young again. Jane and Edith Peckham
were spending the day with us. It was just such
a day as this, warm and bright; light, fleecy clouds
flitting across the blue sky. I wish Lavinia were out
to enjoy it! but she is hardly strong enough for long
walks yet, and only potters about, when she does get
out, in the Rue des Arbres or the Grande Place, or
perhaps over to see Mary Carimon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I lay awake all last
night, and sat moping yesterday, thinking what I
<em>could</em> do. Edwin wants me to marry him; I told
Lavinia, and she absolutely forbids it, saying I should
rush upon misery. <em>He</em> says I should be happy as the
day&rsquo;s long. I feel like a distracted lunatic, not knowing
which of them is right, or which opinion I ought to
yield to. I have obeyed Lavinia all my life; we have
never had a difference before; her wishes have been
mine, and mine have been hers. But I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> see why
she need have taken up this prejudice against him,
for I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s more like an angel than a man; and,
as he whispers to me, Nancy Fennel would be a
prettier name than Nancy Preen. I said to him to-day,
&lsquo;My name is Ann, not really Nancy.&rsquo; &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo;
he answered, &lsquo;I shall always call you Nancy; I love
the simple name.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I no longer talk about him to Lavinia, or let her
suspect that we still meet on the pier. It would make
her angry, and I can&rsquo;t bear that. I dare not hint to
her what Edwin said to-day&mdash;that he should take
matters into his own hands. He means to go over to
Dover, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">viâ</i> Calais; stay at Dover a fortnight, as the
marriage law requires, and then come back to fetch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
me; and after the marriage has taken place we shall
return here to live.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, what am I to do? It will be a <em>dreadful</em>
thing to deceive Lavinia; and it will be equally
dreadful to lose <em>him</em>. He declares that if I do not
agree to this he shall set sail for India (where he used
to be with his regiment), and never, never see me again.
Good gracious! <em>never</em> to see me again!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst is, he wants to go off to Dover at once,
giving one no time for consideration! Must I say
Yes, or No? The uncertainty shakes me to pieces. He
laughed to-day when I said something of this, assuring
me Lavinia&rsquo;s anger would pass away like a summer
cloud when I was his wife; that sisters had no
authority over one another, and that Lavinia&rsquo;s opposition
arose from selfishness only, because she did not
want to lose me. &lsquo;<em>Risk it</em>, Nancy,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;she will
receive you with open arms when I bring you back
from Dover.&rsquo; If I could only think so! Now and then
I feel inclined to confide my dilemma to Mary Carimon,
and ask her opinion, only that I fear she might tell
Lavinia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr. Edwin Fennel quitted Sainteville. When he
was missed people thought he might have gone for
good. But one Saturday morning some time onwards,
when the month of May was drawing towards its close,
Miss Lavinia, out with Nancy at market, came full
upon Captain Fennel in the crowd on the Grande
Place. He held out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you had left Sainteville, Mr. Fennel,&rdquo;
she remarked, meeting his hand and the sinister look
in his face unwillingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Got back this morning,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;travelled by
night. Shall be leaving again to-day or to-morrow.
How are <em>you</em>, Miss Nancy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia pushed her way to the nearest poultry stall.
&ldquo;Will you come here, Ann?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to
choose a fowl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She began to bargain, half in French, half in English,
with the poultry man, all to get rid of that other man,
and she looked round, expecting Nancy had followed
her. Nancy had not stirred from the spot near the
butter-baskets: she and Captain Fennel had their
heads together, he talking hard and fast.</p>

<p>They saw Lavinia looking at them; looking angry,
too. &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; impressively whispered Captain
Fennel to Nancy: and, lifting his hat to Lavinia, over
the white caps of the market-women, he disappeared
across the Place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what that man has come back for?&rdquo;
cried Miss Preen, as Nancy reached her&mdash;not that she
had any suspicion. &ldquo;And I wonder you should stay
talking with him, Nancy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy did not answer.</p>

<p>Sending Flore&mdash;who had attended them with her
market-basket&mdash;home with the fowl and eggs and
vegetables, they called at the butcher&rsquo;s and the
grocer&rsquo;s, and then went home themselves. Miss
Preen then remembered that she had forgotten one
or two things, and must go out again. Nancy
remained at home. When Lavinia returned, which
was not for an hour, for she had met various friends
and stayed to gossip, her sister was in her room.
Flore thought Mademoiselle Nancy was setting her
drawers to rights: she had heard her opening and
shutting them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Time went on until the afternoon. Just before five
o&rsquo;clock, when Flore came into lay the cloth for dinner,
Lavinia, sitting at the window, saw her sister leave
the house and cross the yard, a good-sized paper parcel
in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that is Miss Nancy,&rdquo; she exclaimed, in much
surprise. &ldquo;Where can she be going to now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Nancy came down the stairs as I was
coming in here,&rdquo; replied Flore. &ldquo;She said to me
that she had just time to run to Madame Carimon&rsquo;s
before dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; dissented Miss Lavinia. &ldquo;What can she
be going for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As five o&rsquo;clock struck, Flore (always punctual, from
self-interest) came in to ask if she should serve the
fish; but was told to wait until Miss Nancy returned.
When half-past five was at hand, and Nancy had not
appeared, Miss Preen ordered the fish in, remarking
that Madame Carimon must be keeping her sister to
dinner.</p>

<p>Afterwards Miss Preen set out for the casino, expecting
she should meet them both there; for Lavinia
and Nancy had intended to go. Madame Carimon
was not a subscriber, but she sometimes paid her
ten sous and went in. It would be quite a pretty
sight to-night&mdash;a children&rsquo;s dance. Lavinia soon
joined some friends there, but the others did not
come.</p>

<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock she was in the Rue Pomme Cuite,
approaching Madame Carimon&rsquo;s. Pauline, in her short
woollen petticoats, and shoeless feet thrust into wooden
sabots, was splashing buckets of water before the door
to scrub the pavement, and keeping up a screaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
chatter with the other servants in the street, who
were doing the same, Saturday-night fashion.</p>

<p>Madame Carimon was in the salon, sitting idle in
the fading light; her sewing lay on the table.
Lavinia&rsquo;s eyes went round the room, but she saw no
one else in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary, where is Nancy?&rdquo; she asked, as Madame
Carimon rose to greet her with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Madame Carimon
lightly. &ldquo;She has not been here. Did you think
she had?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She dined here&mdash;did she not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Nancy? Oh no! I and Jules dined
alone. He is out now, giving a French lesson. I
have not seen Nancy since&mdash;let me see&mdash;since Thursday,
I think; the day before yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia Preen sat down, half-bewildered. She
related the history of the evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is elsewhere that Nancy is gone,&rdquo; remarked
Madame Carimon. &ldquo;Flore must have misunderstood
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Concluding that to be the case, and that Nancy
might already be at home, Lavinia returned at once
to the Petite Maison Rouge, Mary Carimon bearing
her company in the sweet summer twilight. Lavinia
opened the door with her latch-key. Flore had
departed long before. There were three latch-keys
to the house, Nancy possessing one of them.</p>

<p>They looked into every room, and called out
&ldquo;Nancy! Nancy!&rdquo; But she was not there.</p>

<p>Nancy Preen had gone off with Captain Fennel
by the six-o&rsquo;clock train, en route for Dover, there to
be converted into Mrs. Fennel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>And had Nancy foreseen the terrible events and
final crime which this most disastrous step would
bring about, she might have chosen, rather than take
it, to run away to the Protestant cemetery outside the
gates of Sainteville, there to lay herself down to die.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Where <em>can</em> Nancy be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Preen spoke these words to Mary Carimon in
a sort of flurry. After letting themselves into the
house, the Petite Maison Rouge, and calling up and
down it in vain for Nancy, the question as to where
she could be naturally arose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must be spending the evening with the friends
she stayed to dine with,&rdquo; said Madame Carimon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where she would be likely to stay.
Unless&mdash;yes&mdash;perhaps at Mrs. Hardy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That must be it, Lavinia,&rdquo; pronounced Madame
Carimon.</p>

<p>It was then getting towards nine o&rsquo;clock. They set
out again for Mrs. Hardy&rsquo;s to escort Nancy home.
She lived in the Rue Lothaire; a long street, leading
to the railway-station.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy was an elderly lady. When near her
door they saw her grand-nephew, Charles Palliser, turn
out of it. Charley was a good-hearted young fellow,
the son of a rich merchant in London. He was staying
at Sainteville for the purpose of acquiring the art
of speaking French as a native.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looking for Miss Ann Preen!&rdquo; cried he, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
explained in a word or two. &ldquo;No, she is not at our
house; has not been there. I saw her going off this
evening by the six-o&rsquo;clock train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going off by the six-o&rsquo;clock train!&rdquo; echoed Miss
Lavinia, staring at him. &ldquo;Why, what do you mean,
Mr. Charles? My sister has not gone off by any
train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was in this way,&rdquo; answered the young man, too
polite to flatly contradict a lady. &ldquo;Mrs. Hardy&rsquo;s
cousin, Louise Soubitez, came to town this morning;
she spent the day with us, and after dinner I went to
see her off by the train. And there, at the station,
was Miss Ann Preen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not going away by train,&rdquo; returned Miss
Lavinia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, she was. I watched the train out of
the station. She and Louise Soubitez sat in the same
compartment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A smile stole to Charles Palliser&rsquo;s face. In truth,
he was amused at Miss Lavinia&rsquo;s consternation. It
suddenly struck her that the young man was joking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you speak to Ann, Mr. Charles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; just a few words. There was not time
for much conversation; Louise was late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Preen felt a little shaken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was Ann alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; she was with Captain Fennel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, with that, a suspicion of the truth, and the full
horror of it, dawned upon Lavinia Preen. She grasped
Madame Carimon&rsquo;s arm and turned white as death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It never can be,&rdquo; she whispered, her lips trembling:
&ldquo;it never can be! She cannot have&mdash;have&mdash;run
away&mdash;with that man!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Unconsciously perhaps to herself, her eyes were
fixed on Charles. He thought the question was put
to him, and answered it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid it looks like it, as she seems
to have said nothing to you,&rdquo; he slowly said. &ldquo;But I
give you my word, Miss Preen, that until this moment
that aspect of the matter never suggested itself to me.
I supposed they were just going up the line together
for some purpose or other; though, in fact, I hardly
thought about it at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And perhaps that is all the mystery!&rdquo; interposed
Madame Carimon briskly. &ldquo;He may have taken Ann
to Drecques for a little jaunt, and they will be back
again by the last train. It must be almost due,
Lavinia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With one impulse they turned to the station, which
was near at hand. Drecques, a village, was the first
place the trains stopped at on the up-line. The
passengers were already issuing from the gate. Standing
aside until all had passed, and not seeing Nancy
anywhere, Charley Palliser looked into the omnibuses.
But she was not there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may have intended to come back and missed
the train, Miss Preen; it&rsquo;s very easy to miss a train,&rdquo;
said he in his good nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it must be so, Lavinia,&rdquo; spoke up Madame
Carimon. &ldquo;Any way, we will assume it until we hear
to the contrary. And, Charley, we had better not talk
of this to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Charley earnestly. &ldquo;You may
be sure of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unless Captain Fennel and Miss Ann Preen
chartered a balloon, there was little probability of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
their reaching Sainteville that evening, for this had
been the last train. Lavinia Preen passed a night of
discomfort, striving to hope against hope, as the saying
runs. Not a very wise saying; it might run better,
striving to hope against despair.</p>

<p>When Sunday did not bring back the truants, or
any news of them, the three in the secret&mdash;Mary
Carimon, Lavinia, and Charley Palliser&mdash;had little
doubt that the disappearance meant an elopement.
Monsieur Jules Carimon, not easily understanding
such an escapade, so little in accordance with the
customs and manners of his own country, said in his
wife&rsquo;s ear he hoped it would turn out that there was
a marriage in the case.</p>

<p>Miss Preen received a letter from Dover pretty
early in the week, written by Ann. She had been
married that day to Captain Fennel.</p>

<p>Altogether, the matter was the most bitter blow
ever yet dealt to Lavinia Preen. No living being
knew, or ever would know, how cruelly her heart was
wrung by it. But, being a kindly woman of good
sound sense, she saw that the best must be made of
it, not the worst; and this she set herself out to do.
She began by hoping that her own instinct, warning
her against Captain Fennel, might be a mistaken one,
and that he had a good home to offer his wife and
would make her happy in it.</p>

<p>She knew no more about him&mdash;his family, his
fortune, his former life, his antecedents&mdash;than she
knew of the man in the moon. Major Smith perhaps
did; he had been acquainted with him in the past.
Nancy&rsquo;s letter, though written the previous day, had
been delivered by the afternoon post. As soon as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
could get dinner over, Lavinia went to Major Smith&rsquo;s.
He lived at the top of the Rue Lambeau, a street
turning out of the Grande Place. He and his wife,
their own dinner just removed, were sitting together,
the major indulging in a steaming glass of schiedam
and water, flavoured with a slice of lemon. He was
a very jolly little man, with rosy cheeks and a bald
head. They welcomed Miss Lavinia warmly. She,
not quite as composed as usual, opened her business
without preamble; her sister Ann had married
Captain Fennel, and she had come to ask Major
Smith what he knew of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; answered the major.</p>

<p>There was something behind his tone, and Lavinia
burst into tears. Compassionating her distress, the
major offered her a comforting glass, similar to his
own. Lavinia declined it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will tell me what you know,&rdquo; she said; and
he proceeded to do so.</p>

<p>Edwin Fennel, the son of Colonel Fennel, was stationed
in India with his regiment for several years.
He got on well enough, but was not much liked by
his brother officers: they thought him unscrupulous
and deceitful. All at once, something very disagreeable
occurred, which obliged Captain Fennel to quit
her Majesty&rsquo;s service. The affair was hushed up, out
of consideration to his family and his father&rsquo;s long
term of service. &ldquo;In fact, I believe he was allowed
to retire, instead of being cashiered,&rdquo; added the major,
&ldquo;but I am not quite sure which it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it that occurred&mdash;that Captain Fennel
did, to necessitate his dismissal?&rdquo; questioned Lavinia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much like to mention it,&rdquo; said the major,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
shaking his head. &ldquo;It might get about, you see,
Miss Preen, which would make it awkward for him.
I have no wish, or right either, to do the man a
gratuitous injury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise you it shall not get about through me,&rdquo;
returned Lavinia; &ldquo;my sister&rsquo;s being his wife will be
the best guarantee for that. You must please tell me,
Major Smith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Fennel was suspected&mdash;detected, in short&mdash;of
cheating at cards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia drew a deep breath. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she
said presently, in an undertone, &ldquo;that when I first
met the man I shrank from his face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh my! And it has such nice features!&rdquo; put in
Mrs. Smith, who was but a silly little woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was something in its shifty look which
spoke to me as a warning,&rdquo; continued Lavinia. &ldquo;It
did, indeed. All my life I have been able to read
faces, and my first instinct has rarely, if ever, deceived
me. Each time I have seen this man since, that
instinct against him has become stronger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Smith took a sip at his schiedam. &ldquo;I believe&mdash;between
ourselves&mdash;he is just a mauvais sujet,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;He has a brother who is one, out and out; as
I chance to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is Edwin Fennel&rsquo;s income, major?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell at all. I should not be surprised to
hear that he has none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does he live then?&rdquo; asked Lavinia, her heart
going at a gallop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know that either,&rdquo; said the major. &ldquo;His
father is dead now and can&rsquo;t help him. A very
respectable man, the old colonel, but always poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He cannot live upon air; he must have some
means,&rdquo; debated Lavinia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lives upon his wits, perhaps; some men do. He
wanted to borrow ten pounds from me a short time
ago,&rdquo; added the major, taking another sip at his
tumbler; &ldquo;but I told him I had no money to lend&mdash;which
was a fact. I have an idea that he got it out
of Charley Palliser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The more Lavinia Preen heard of this unhappy case,
the worse it seemed to be. Declining to stay for tea,
as Mrs. Smith wished, she betook her miserable steps
home again, rather wishing that the sea would swallow
up Captain Fennel.</p>

<p>The next day she saw Charles Palliser. Pouncing
upon him as he was airing his long legs in the Grande
Place, she put the question to him in so determined a
way that Charley had no chance against her. He
turned red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who can have set that about,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s true, Miss Preen. Fennel pressed me
to lend him ten pounds for a month; and I&mdash;well, I
did it. I happened to have it in my pocket, you see,
having just cashed a remittance from my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he repaid you, Mr. Charles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the month&rsquo;s not quite up yet,&rdquo; cried Charley.
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t talk of it, Miss Preen; he wouldn&rsquo;t like
it, you know. How on earth it has slipped out I can&rsquo;t
imagine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I shall not talk of it,&rdquo; said Lavinia, as she
wished him good-day and walked onwards, wondering
what sort of a home Captain Fennel meant to provide
for Ann.</p>

<p>Lavinia Preen&rsquo;s cup of sorrow was not yet full. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
morning or two after this she was seated at breakfast
with the window open, when she saw the postman
come striding across the yard with a letter. It was
from the bride; a very short letter, and one that
Miss Lavinia did not at once understand. She read it
again.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="smcap">&ldquo;My dear Lavinia,</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;All being well, we shall be home to-morrow;
that is, on the day you receive this letter; reaching
Sainteville by the last train in the evening. Please
get something nice and substantial for tea, Edwin
says, and please see that Flore has the bedroom in
good order.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2">&ldquo;Your affectionate sister,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Ann Fennel.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>
</div>

<p>The thing that Miss Lavinia did, when comprehension
came to her, was to fly into a passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come home here&mdash;<em>he!</em>&mdash;is that what she means?&rdquo;
cried she. &ldquo;Never. Have that man in my house?
Never, never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what has mademoiselle received?&rdquo; exclaimed
Flore, appearing just then with a boiled egg. &ldquo;Is it
bad news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is news that I will not put up with&mdash;will not
tolerate,&rdquo; cried Miss Lavinia. And, in the moment&rsquo;s
dismay, she told the woman what it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tiens!&rdquo; commented Flore, taking a common-sense
view of matters: &ldquo;they must be coming just to show
themselves to mademoiselle on their marriage. Likely
enough they will not stay more than a night or two,
while looking out for an apartment.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Lavinia did not believe it; but the very suggestion
somewhat soothed her. To receive that man even for
a night or two, as Flore put it, would be to her most
repugnant, cruel pain, and she resolved not to do it.
Breakfast over, she carried the letter and her trouble
to the Rue Pomme Cuite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am afraid, Lavinia, you cannot refuse to
receive them,&rdquo; spoke Madame Carimon, after considering
the problem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not refuse to receive them!&rdquo; echoed Lavinia.
&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Mary Carimon uneasily, for she
disliked to add to trouble, &ldquo;you see the house is as
much Ann&rsquo;s as yours. It was taken in your joint
names. Ann has the right to return to it; and
also, I suppose&rdquo;&mdash;more dubiously&mdash;&ldquo;to introduce her
husband into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that French law?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so. I&rsquo;ll ask Jules when he comes home
to dinner. Would it not be English law also, Lavinia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia was feeling wretchedly uncomfortable.
With all her plain common-sense, this phase of the
matter had not struck her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; said she&mdash;and there stopped, for she was
seized with a violent shivering, which seemed difficult
to be accounted for. &ldquo;Mary, if that man has to take
up his abode in the house, I can never remain in it.
I would rather die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, dear friend,&rdquo; whispered Mary: &ldquo;life is
full of trouble&mdash;as Job tells us in the Holy Scriptures&mdash;none
of us are exempt from it. It attacks us all in
turn. The only one thing we can do is to strive to
make the best of it, under God; to ask Him to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
us. I am afraid there is a severe cross before you,
Lavinia; better <em>bear</em> it than fight against it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will never bear <em>that</em>,&rdquo; retorted Lavinia, turning
a deaf ear in her anger. &ldquo;You ought not to wish me
to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I would not if I saw anything better for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Veuve Sauvage, sitting as usual at her
front-window that same morning, was surprised at
receiving an early call from her tenant, Miss Preen.
Madame handed her into her best crimson velvet
fauteuil, and they began talking.</p>

<p>Not to much purpose, however; for neither very
well understood what the other said. Lavinia tried
to explain the object of her visit, but found her French
was not equal to it. Madame called her maid,
Mariette, and sent her into the shop below to ask
Monsieur Gustave to be good enough to step up.</p>

<p>Lavinia had gone to beg of them to cancel the
agreement for the little house, so far as her sister was
concerned, and to place it in her name only.</p>

<p>Monsieur Gustave, when he had mastered the
request, politely answered that such a thing was not
practicable; Miss Ann&rsquo;s name could not be struck out
of the lease without her consent, or, as he expressed
it, breaking the bail. His mother and himself had
every disposition to oblige Miss Preen in any way, as
indeed she must know, but they had no power to act
against the law.</p>

<p>So poor Miss Lavinia went into her home wringing
her hands in despair. She was perfectly helpless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>The summer days went on. Mr. Edwin Fennel, with
all the impudence in the world, had taken up his
abode in the Petite Maison Rouge, without saying
with your leave or by your leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could you <em>think</em> of bringing him here, Ann?&rdquo;
Lavinia demanded of her sister in the first days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not think of it; it was he thought of it,&rdquo;
returned Mrs. Fennel in her simple way. &ldquo;I feared
you would not like it, Lavinia; but what could I do?
He seemed to look upon it as a matter of course that
he should come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, there he was; &ldquo;a matter of course;&rdquo; making
one in the home. Lavinia could not show fight; he
was Ann&rsquo;s husband, and the place was as much Ann&rsquo;s
as hers. The more Lavinia saw of him the more she
disliked him; which was perhaps unreasonable, since
he made himself agreeable to her in social intercourse,
though he took care to have things his own way. If
Lavinia&rsquo;s will went one way in the house and his the
other, she found herself smilingly set at naught. Ann
was his willing slave; and when opinions differed she
sided with her husband.</p>

<p>It was no light charge, having a third person in the
house to live upon their small income, especially one
who studied his appetite. For a very short time
Lavinia, in her indignation at affairs generally, turned
the housekeeping over to Mrs. Fennel. But she had
to take to it again. Ann was naturally an incautious
manager; she ordered in delicacies to please her
husband&rsquo;s palate without regard to cost, and nothing
could have come of that but debt and disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>That the gallant ex-Captain Fennel had married
Ann Preen just to have a roof over his head, Lavinia
felt as sure of as that the moon occasionally shone in
the heavens. She did not suppose he had any other
refuge in the wide world. And through something told
her by Ann she judged that he had believed he was
doing better for himself in marrying than he had done.</p>

<p>The day after the marriage Mr. and Mrs. Fennel
were sitting on a bench at Dover, romantically gazing
at the sea, honeymoon fashion, and talking of course
of hearts and darts. Suddenly the bridegroom turned
his thoughts to more practical things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nancy, how do you receive your money&mdash;half-yearly
or quarterly?&rdquo; asked he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, quarterly,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;It is paid punctually
to us by the acting-trustee, Colonel Selby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. Then you have thirty-five pounds every
quarter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between us, we do,&rdquo; assented Nancy. &ldquo;Lavinia
has seventeen pounds ten, and I have the same; and
the colonel makes us each give a receipt for our own
share.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Fennel turned his head and gazed at her
with a hard stare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You told me your income was a hundred and forty
pounds a-year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is that exactly,&rdquo; said she quietly; &ldquo;mine
and Lavinia&rsquo;s together. We do not each have that,
Edwin; I never meant to imply&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Fennel broke off, frightened. On the captain&rsquo;s
face, cruel enough just then, there sat an expression
which she might have thought diabolical had it been
any one else&rsquo;s face. Any way, it scared her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>

<p>Rising rapidly, Captain Fennel walked forward,
caught up some pebbles, flung them from him and
waited, apparently watching to see where they fell.
Then he strolled back again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you angry with me?&rdquo; faltered Nancy.
&ldquo;Had I done anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, what should you have done? Angry?&rdquo;
repeated he, in a light tone, as if intensely amused.
&ldquo;You must not take up fancies, Mrs. Fennel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose Mrs. Selby thought it would be sufficient
income for us, both living together,&rdquo; remarked Nancy.
&ldquo;If either of us should die it all lapses to the other.
We found it quite enough last year, I assure you,
Edwin; Sainteville is so cheap a place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, delightfully cheap!&rdquo; agreed the captain.</p>

<p>It was this conversation that Nancy repeated to
Lavinia; but she did not speak of the queer look
which had frightened her. Lavinia saw that Mr.
Edwin Fennel had taken up a wrong idea of their
income. Of course the disappointment angered him.</p>

<p>An aspect of semi-courtesy was outwardly maintained
in the intercourse of home life. Lavinia was a
gentlewoman; she had not spoken unpleasant things
to the captain&rsquo;s face, or hinted that he was a weight
upon the housekeeping pocket; whilst he, as yet, was
quite officiously civil to her. But there was no love
lost between them; and Lavinia could not divest her
mind of an undercurrent of conviction that he was, in
some way or other, a man to be dreaded.</p>

<p>Thus Captain Fennel (as he was mostly called),
being domiciled with the estimable ladies in the Petite
Maison Rouge, grew to be considered one of the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
colony of Sainteville, and was received as such. As
nobody knew aught against him, nobody thought
anything. Major Smith had not spoken of antecedents,
neither had Miss Preen; the Carimons, who were in
the secret, never spoke ill of any one: and as the
captain could assume pleasing manners at will, he
became fairly well liked by his country-people in a
passing sort of way.</p>

<p>Lavinia Preen sat one day upon the low edge of
the pier, her back to the sun and the sea. She had
called in at the little shoe-shop on the port, just as
you turn out of the Rue Tessin, and had left her
parasol there. The sun was not then out in the grey
sky, and she did not miss it. Now that the sun was
shining, and the grey canopy above had become blue,
she said to herself that she had been stupid. It was
September weather, so the sun was not unbearable.</p>

<p>Lavinia Preen was thinner; the thraldom of the
past three months had made her so. Now and then
it would cross her mind to leave the Petite Maison
Rouge to its married inmates; but for Nancy&rsquo;s sake
she hesitated. Nancy had made the one love of her
life, and Nancy had loved her in return. Now, the
love was chiefly given to the new tie she had formed;
Lavinia was second in every respect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They go their way now, and I have to go mine,&rdquo;
sighed Lavinia, as she sat this morning on the pier.
&ldquo;Even my walks have to be solitary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cloud came sailing up and the sun went in again.
Lavinia rose; she walked onwards till she came to
the end of the pier, where she again sat down. The
next moment, chancing to look the way she had come,
she saw a lady and gentleman advancing arm-in-arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>they</em> are on the pier, are they!&rdquo; mentally
spoke Lavinia. For it was Mr. and Mrs. Edwin
Fennel.</p>

<p>Nancy sat down beside her. &ldquo;It is a long walk!&rdquo;
cried she, drawing a quick breath or two. &ldquo;Lavinia,
what do you think we have just heard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I tell?&rdquo; returned the elder sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know those queer people, an old English aunt
and three nieces, who took Madame Gibon&rsquo;s rooms in
the Rue Ménar? They have all disappeared and
have paid nobody,&rdquo; continued Nancy. &ldquo;Charley
Palliser told us just how; he was laughing like
anything over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought they looked like people to be
trusted,&rdquo; remarked Lavinia. &ldquo;Dear me! here&rsquo;s the
sun coming out again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your parasol?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia recounted her negligence in having left it
at the shoe-mart. Captain Fennel had brought out
a small silk umbrella; he turned from the end of the
pier, where he stood looking out to sea, opened the
umbrella, and offered it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not much larger than a good-sized parasol,&rdquo;
remarked he. &ldquo;Pray take it, Miss Lavinia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia did so after a moment&rsquo;s imperceptible
hesitation, and thanked him. She hated to be under
the slightest obligation to him, but the sun was now
full in her eyes, and might make her head ache.</p>

<p>The pleasant smell of a cigar caused them to look
up. A youngish man, rather remarkably tall, with a
shepherd&rsquo;s plaid across his broad shoulders, was striding
up the pier. He sat down near Miss Preen, and she
glanced round at him. Appearing to think that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
looked at his cigar, he immediately threw it into
the sea behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am sorry you did that,&rdquo; said Lavinia, speaking
impulsively. &ldquo;I like the smell of a cigar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you; thank you very much,&rdquo; he
answered. &ldquo;I had nearly smoked it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Voice and manner were alike pleasant and easy,
and Lavinia spoke again&mdash;some trivial remark about
the fine expanse of sea; upon which they drifted into
conversation. We are reserved enough with strangers
at home, we Islanders, as the world knows, but most
of us are less ungracious abroad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sainteville seems a clean, healthy place,&rdquo; remarked
the new-comer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Miss Lavinia. &ldquo;Do you know it
well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw it before to-day,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I
have come here from Douai to meet a friend, having
two or three days to spare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douai is a fine town,&rdquo; remarked Captain Fennel,
turning to speak, for he was still looking out over the
sea, and had his opera-glasses in his hand. &ldquo;I spent
a week there not long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douai!&rdquo; exclaimed Nancy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the place
where the great Law Courts are, is it not? Don&rsquo;t
you remember the man last year, Lavinia, who committed
some dreadful crime, and was taken up to
Douai to be tried at the Assizes there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have a great case coming on there as soon as
the Courts meet,&rdquo; said the stranger, who seemed a
talkative man; &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s what I am at Douai for.
A case of extensive swindling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a lawyer, I presume?&rdquo; said Miss Preen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The stranger nodded. &ldquo;Being the only one of our
London firm who can speak French readily, and we
are four of us in it, I had to come over and watch this
affair and wait for the trial. For the young fellow is
an Englishman, I am sorry to say, and his people,
worthy and well-to-do merchants, are nearly mad
over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But did he commit it in England?&rdquo; cried Miss
Preen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no; in France, within the arrondissement of
the Douai Courts. He is in prison there. I dare say
you get some swindling in a petty way even at
Sainteville,&rdquo; added the speaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That we do,&rdquo; put in Nancy. &ldquo;An English family
of ladies ran away only yesterday, owing twenty
pounds at least, it is said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the stranger, with a smile. &ldquo;I think
the ladies are sometimes more clever at that game
than the men. By the way,&rdquo; he went on briskly, &ldquo;do
you know a Mr. Dangerfield at Sainteville?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Lavinia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is staying here, I believe, or has been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; said Lavinia. &ldquo;I never
heard his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Changed it again, probably,&rdquo; carelessly observed
the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Dangerfield not his true name, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as much as it is mine, madam. His real
name is Fennel; but he has found it convenient to
drop that on occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now it was a curious fact that Nancy did not hear
the name which the stranger had given as the true
one. Her attention was diverted by some men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
were working at the mud in the harbour, for it was
low water, and who were loudly disputing together.
Nancy had moved to the side of the pier to look down
at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he a swindler, that Mr. Dangerfield?&rdquo; asked
she, half-turning her head to speak. But the stranger
did not answer.</p>

<p>As to Lavinia, the avowal had struck her speechless.
She glanced at Captain Fennel. He had his back to
them, and stood immovable, apparently unconcerned,
possibly not having heard. A thought struck her&mdash;and
frightened her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know that Mr. Dangerfield yourself?&rdquo; she
asked the stranger, in a tone of indifference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a man coming
over in yonder boat who does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pointed over his shoulder at the sea as he spoke.
Lavinia glanced quickly in the same direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In yonder boat?&rdquo; she repeated vaguely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean the London boat, which is on its way here,
and will get in this evening,&rdquo; he explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; said Lavinia, as if her wits had
been wool-gathering.</p>

<p>The young man took out his watch and looked at
it. Then he rose, lifted his hat, and, with a general
good-morning, walked quickly down the pier.</p>

<p>Nancy was still at the side of the pier, looking down
at the men. Captain Fennel put up his glasses and sat
down beside Lavinia, his impassive face still as usual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder who that man is?&rdquo; he cried, watching
the footsteps of the retreating stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what he said?&rdquo; asked Lavinia,
dropping her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Had Nancy not been here, I should have
given him a taste of my mind; but she hates even the
semblance of a quarrel. He had no right to say what
he did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could it have meant?&rdquo; murmured Lavinia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It meant my brother, I expect,&rdquo; said Captain
Fennel savagely, and, as Lavinia thought, with every
appearance of truth. &ldquo;But he has never been at
Sainteville, so far as I know; the fellow is mistaken
in that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he pass under the name of Dangerfield?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly. This is the first I&rsquo;ve heard of it. He is
an extravagant man, often in embarrassment from
debt. There&rsquo;s nothing worse against him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not say more; neither did Lavinia. They
sat on in silence. The tall figure in the Scotch plaid
disappeared from sight; the men in the harbour kept
on disputing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long are you going to stay here?&rdquo; asked
Nancy, turning towards her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to go now,&rdquo; he answered. And giving
his arm to Nancy, they walked down the pier together.</p>

<p>Never a word to Lavinia; never a question put by
him or by Nancy, if only to say, &ldquo;Are you not coming
with us?&rdquo; It was ever so now. Nancy, absorbed in
her husband, neglected her sister.</p>

<p>Lavinia sighed. She sat on a little while longer,
and then took her departure.</p>

<p>The shoe-shop on the port was opposite the place in
the harbour where the London steamers were generally
moored. The one now there was taking in cargo.
As Lavinia was turning into the shop for her parasol,
she heard a stentorian English voice call out to a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
who was superintending the work in his shirt-sleeves:
&ldquo;At what hour does this boat leave to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At eight o&rsquo;clock, sir,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Eight
sharp; we want to get away with the first o&rsquo; the
tide.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>From Miss Lavinia Preen&rsquo;s Diary.</h4>

<p><i>September 22nd.</i>&mdash;The town clocks have just struck
eight, and I could almost fancy that I hear the faint
sound of the boat steaming down the harbour in the
dark night, carrying Nancy away with it, and carrying
<em>him</em>. However, that is fancy and nothing else, for
the sound could not penetrate to me here.</p>

<p>Perhaps it surprised me, perhaps it did not, when
Nancy came to me this afternoon as I was sitting in
my bedroom reading Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;Legend of Montrose,&rdquo;
which Mary Carimon had lent me from her little stock
of English books, and said she and Captain Fennel
were going to London that night by the boat. He
had received a letter, he told her, calling him thither.
He might tell Nancy that if he liked, but it would
not do for me. He is going, I can only believe, in
consequence of what that gentleman in the shepherd&rsquo;s
plaid said on the pier to-day. Can it be that the
&ldquo;Mr. Dangerfield&rdquo; spoken of applies to Edwin Fennel
himself and not to his brother? Is he finding himself
in some dangerous strait, and is running away from
the individual coming over in the approaching boat,
who personally knows Mr. Dangerfield? &ldquo;Can you
lend me a five-pound note, Lavinia?&rdquo; Nancy went
on, when she had told me the news; &ldquo;lend it to
myself, I mean. I will repay you when I receive my
next quarter&rsquo;s income, which is due, you know, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
few days.&rdquo; I chanced to have a five-pound note by
me in my own private store, and I gave it her,
reminding her that unless she did let me have it
again, it would be so much less in hand to meet
expenses with, and that I had found difficulty enough
in the past quarter. &ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; said Nancy,
&ldquo;if I and Edwin stay away a week or two, you will
be spared our housekeeping; and when our money
comes, Lavinia, you can open my letter and repay
yourself if I am not here. I don&rsquo;t at all know where
we are going to stay,&rdquo; she said, in answer to my
question. &ldquo;I was beginning to ask Edwin just now
in the other room, but he was busy packing his
portmanteau, and told me not to bother him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so, there it is: they are gone, and I am left
here all alone.</p>

<p>I wonder whether any Mr. Dangerfield has been at
Sainteville? I think we should have heard the name.
Why, that is the door-bell! I must go and answer it.</p>

<p>It was Charley Palliser. He had come with a
message from Major and Mrs. Smith. They are going
to Drecques to-morrow morning by the eleven-o&rsquo;clock
train with a few friends and a basket of provisions,
and had sent Charley to say they would be glad of
my company. &ldquo;Do come, Miss Preen,&rdquo; urged Charley
as I hesitated; &ldquo;you are all alone now, and I&rsquo;m sure
it must be dreadfully dull.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know I am alone?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Charley, &ldquo;I have been watching
the London boat out, and I saw Captain Fennel and
your sister go by it. Major and Mrs. Smith were with
me. It is a lovely night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; I said, as Charley was about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
depart when I had accepted the invitation. &ldquo;Do you
know whether an Englishman named Dangerfield is
living here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think there is; I have not met with him,&rdquo;
said Charley. &ldquo;Why, Miss Preen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, only that I was asked to-day whether I knew
any one of that name,&rdquo; I returned carelessly. &ldquo;Good-night,
Mr. Charles. Thank you for coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They have invited me, finding I was left alone, and
I think it very kind of them. But the Smiths are
both kind-hearted people.</p>

<p><i>September 23rd.</i>&mdash;Half-past nine o&rsquo;clock, p.m. Have
just returned from Drecques by the last train after
spending a pleasant day. Quiet, of course, for there
is not much to do at Drecques except stroll over the
ruins of the old castle, or saunter about the quaint
little ancient town, and go into the grand old church.
It was so fine and warm that we had dinner on the
grass, the people at the cottage bringing our plates
and knives and forks. Later in the day we took tea
indoors. In the afternoon, when all the rest were
scattered about and the major sat smoking his cigar
on the bench under the trees, I sat down by him to
tell him what happened yesterday, and I begged him
to give me his opinion. It was no betrayal of confidence,
for Major Smith is better acquainted with the
shady side of the Fennels than I am.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard there was an English lawyer staying at
the Hôtel des Princes, and that he had come here from
Douai,&rdquo; observed the major. &ldquo;His name&rsquo;s Lockett.
It must have been he who spoke to you on the
pier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Do you know, major, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
any one has stayed at Sainteville passing as Mr.
Dangerfield?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; replied the major. &ldquo;Unless he
has kept himself remarkably quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could it apply to Captain Fennel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never knew that he had gone under an assumed
name. The accusation is one more likely to apply to
his brother than to himself. James Fennel is unscrupulous,
very incautious: notwithstanding that, I
like him better than I like the other. There&rsquo;s something
about Edwin Fennel that repels you; at least, it
does me; but one can hardly help liking James,
mauvais sujet though he is,&rdquo; added the speaker,
pausing to flirt off the ashes of his cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doubt pointing to Edwin Fennel in the affair
is his suddenly decamping,&rdquo; continued Major Smith.
&ldquo;It was quite impromptu, you say, Miss Preen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so. I feel sure he had no thought of going
away in the morning; and he did not receive any
letter from England later, which was the excuse he
gave Nancy for departing. Rely upon it that what
he heard about the Mr. Dangerfield on the pier drove
him away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that looks suspicious, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I do see it,&rdquo; I answered, unable to conceal
the pain I felt. &ldquo;It was a bitter calamity, Major Smith,
when Nancy married him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a few cautious inquiries in the town, and
try to find out if there&rsquo;s anything against him in
secret, or if any man named Dangerfield has been in
the place and got into a mess. But, indeed, I don&rsquo;t
altogether see that it could apply to him,&rdquo; concluded
the major after a pause. &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t well go under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
two names in the same town; and every one knows
him as Edwin Fennel.&mdash;Here they are, some of them,
coming back!&rdquo; And when the wanderers were close
up, they found Major Smith arguing with me about
the architecture of the castle.</p>

<p>Ten o&rsquo;clock. Time for bed. I am in no haste to go,
for I don&rsquo;t sleep as well as I used to.</p>

<p>A thought has lately sometimes crossed me that this
miserable trouble worries me more than it ought to do.
&ldquo;Accept it as your cross, and <em>yield</em> to it, Lavinia,&rdquo;
says Mary Carimon to me. But I <em>cannot</em> yield to it;
that is, I cannot in the least diminish the anxiety
which always clings to me, or forget the distress and
dread that lie upon me like a shadow. I know that
my life has been on the whole an easy life&mdash;that
during all the years I spent at Selby Court I never
had any trouble; I know that crosses do come to us
all, earlier or later, and that I ought not to be
surprised that &ldquo;no new thing has happened to me,&rdquo;
the world being full of such experiences. I suppose it
is because I have been so exempt from care, that I feel
this the more.</p>

<p>Half-past ten! just half-an-hour writing these last
few lines and <em>thinking</em>! Time I put up. I wonder
when I shall hear from Nancy?</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>A curious phase, taken in conjunction with what
was to follow, now occurred in the history. Miss
Preen began to experience a nervous dread at going
into the Petite Maison Rouge at night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>She could go into the house ten times a-day when
it was empty; she could stay in the house alone in
the evening after Flore took her departure; she could
be its only inmate all night long; and never at these
times have the slightest sense of fear. But if she
went out to spend the evening, she felt an unaccountable
dread, amounting to horror, at entering it when
she arrived home.</p>

<p>It came on suddenly. One evening when Lavinia
had been at Mrs. Hardy&rsquo;s, Charley Palliser having
run over to London, she returned home a little before
ten o&rsquo;clock. Opening the door with her latch-key,
she was stepping into the passage when a sharp
horror of entering it seized her. A dread, as it
seemed to her, of going into the empty house, up the
long, dark, narrow passage. It was the same sort of
sensation that had struck her the first time she
attempted to enter it under the escort of Monsieur
Gustave Sauvage, and it came on now with as little
reason as it had come on then. For Lavinia this
night had not a thought in her mind of fear or
loneliness, or anything else unpleasant. Mrs. Hardy
had been relating a laughable adventure that Charley
Palliser met with on board the boat when going over,
the account of which he had written to her, and
Lavinia was thinking brightly of it all the way home.
She was smiling to herself as she unlatched the door
and opened it. And then, without warning, arose the
horrible fear.</p>

<p>How she conquered it sufficiently to enter the
passage and reach the slab, where her candle and
matches were always placed, she did not know. It
had to be done, for Lavinia Preen could not remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
in the dark yard all night, or patrol the streets;
but her face had turned moist, and her hands
trembled.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of it. Never since had she
come home in the same way at night but the same
terror assailed her; and I must beg the reader to
understand that this is no invention. Devoid of
reason and unaccountable though the terror was,
Lavinia Preen experienced it.</p>

<p>She went out often&mdash;two or three times a-week,
perhaps&mdash;either to dine or to spend the evening.
Captain Fennel and Nancy were still away, and
friends, remembering Miss Preen&rsquo;s solitary position,
invited her.</p>

<p>October had passed, November was passing, and as
yet no news came to Lavinia of the return of the
travellers. At first they did not write to her at all,
leaving her to infer that as the boat reached London
safely they had done the same. After the lapse of
a fortnight she received a short letter from Nancy
telling her really nothing, and not giving any address.
The next letter came towards the end of November,
and was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="smcap">&ldquo;My dear Lavinia,</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;I have not written to you, for, truly, there
is nothing to write about, and almost every day I
expect Edwin to tell me we are going home. Will
you <em>kindly</em> lend me a ten-pound note? Please send
it in a letter. We are staying at Camberwell, and I
enclose you the address in strict confidence. Do not
repeat it to any one&mdash;not even to Mary Carimon. It
is a relation of Edwin&rsquo;s we are staying with, but he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
not well off. I like his wife. Edwin desires his best
regards.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2">&ldquo;Your loving sister,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Nancy.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>
</div>

<p>Miss Preen did not send the ten-pound note. She
wrote to tell Nancy that she could not do it, and was
uncomfortably pressed for money herself in consequence
of Nancy&rsquo;s own action.</p>

<p>The five-pound note borrowed from Lavinia by
Nancy on her departure had not been repaid; neither
had Nancy&rsquo;s share of the previous quarter&rsquo;s money
been remitted. On the usual day of payment at the
end of September, Lavinia&rsquo;s quarterly income came to
her at Sainteville, as was customary; not Nancy&rsquo;s.
For Nancy there came neither money nor letter. The
fact was, Nancy, escorted by her husband, had presented
herself at Colonel Selby&rsquo;s bank&mdash;he was junior
partner and manager of a small private bank in the
City&mdash;the day before the dividends were due, and
personally claimed the quarterly payment, which was
paid to her.</p>

<p>But now, the summary docking of just half their
income was a matter of embarrassment to Miss Preen,
as may readily be imagined. The house expenses had
to go on, with only half the money to meet them.
Lavinia had a little nest-egg of her own, it has been
said before, saved in earlier years; and this she drew
upon, and so kept debt down. But it was very inconvenient,
as well as vexatious. Lavinia told the whole
truth now to Mary Carimon and her husband, with
Nancy&rsquo;s recent application for a ten-pound note, and
her refusal. Little Monsieur Carimon muttered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
word between his closed lips which sounded like
&ldquo;Rat,&rdquo; and was no doubt applied to Edwin Fennel.</p>

<p>Pretty close upon this, Lavinia received a blowing-up
letter from Colonel Selby. Having known Lavinia
when she was in pinafores, the colonel, a peppery man,
considered he had a right to take her to task at will.
He was brother to Paul Selby, of Selby Court, and
heir presumptive to it. The colonel had a wife and
children, and much ado at times to keep them, for his
income was not large at present, and growing-up sons
are expensive.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="smcap">&ldquo;Dear Lavinia,</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;What in the name of common sense could
have induced you to imagine that I should pay the
two quarterly incomes some weeks before they were
due, and to send Ann and that man Fennel here with
your orders that I should do so? Pretty ideas of
trusteeship you must have! If you are over head
and ears in debt, as they tell me, and for that reason
wish to forestall the time for payment, <em>I</em> can&rsquo;t help it.
It is no reason with me. Your money will be forwarded
to Sainteville, at the proper period, to <em>yourself</em>.
Do not ask me again to pay it into Ann&rsquo;s hands, and
to accept her receipt for it. I can do nothing of the
kind. Ann&rsquo;s share will be sent at the same time.
She tells me she is returning to you. She must give
me her own receipt for it, and you must give me
yours.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2">&ldquo;Your affectionate kinsman,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;William Selby.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>
</div>

<p>Just for a few minutes Lavinia Preen did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
understand this letter. What could it mean? Why
had Colonel Selby written it to her? Then the truth
flashed into her mind.</p>

<p>Nancy (induced, of course, by Edwin Fennel) had
gone with him to Colonel Selby, purporting to have
been sent by Lavinia, to ask him to pay them the
quarter&rsquo;s money not due until the end of December,
and not only Nancy&rsquo;s share but Lavinia&rsquo;s as
well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it would have been nothing short of swindling!&rdquo;
cried Lavinia, as she gazed in dismay at the
colonel&rsquo;s letter.</p>

<p>In the indignation of the moment, she took pen and
ink and wrote an answer to William Selby. Partly
enlightening him&mdash;not quite&mdash;but telling him that
her money must never be paid to any one but herself,
and that the present matter had better be hushed up
for Ann&rsquo;s sake, who was as a reed in the hands of the
man she had married.</p>

<p>Colonel Selby exploded a little when he received
this answer. Down he sat in his turn, and wrote
a short, sharp note to Edwin Fennel, giving that
estimable man a little of his mind, and warning him
that he must not be surprised if the police were
advised to look after him.</p>

<p>When Edward Fennel received this decisive note
through an address he had given to Colonel Selby,
but not the one at Camberwell, he called Miss
Lavinia Preen all the laudatory names in the thieves&rsquo;
dictionary.</p>

<p>And on the feast of St. Andrew, which as every one
knows is the last day of November, the letters came
to an end with the following one from Nancy:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;All being well, my dear Lavinia, we propose to
return home by next Sunday&rsquo;s boat, which ought
to get in before three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. On
Wednesday, Edwin met Charley Palliser in the
Strand, and had a chat with him, and heard all the
Sainteville news; not that there seemed much to
hear. Charley says he runs over to London pretty
often now, his mother being ill. Of course you will
not mind waiting dinner for us on Sunday.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2">&ldquo;Ever your loving sister,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Ann.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>
</div>

<p>So at length they were coming! Either that threat
of being looked after by the police had been too much
for Captain Fennel, or the failure to obtain funds was
cutting short his stay in London. Any way, they
were coming. Lavinia laid the letter beside her
breakfast-plate and fell into thought. She resolved
to welcome them graciously, and to say nothing about
bygones.</p>

<p>Flore was told the news, and warned that instead
of dining at half-past one on the morrow, the usual
Sunday hour, it would be delayed until three. Flore
did not much like the prospect of her afternoon&rsquo;s
holiday being shortened, but there was no help for
it. Lavinia provided a couple of ducks for dinner,
going into the market after breakfast to buy them;
the dish was an especial favourite of the captain&rsquo;s.
She invited Mary Carimon to partake of it, for Monsieur
Carimon was going to spend Sunday at Lille
with an old friend of his, who was now master of the
college there.</p>

<p>On this evening, Saturday, Lavinia dined out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
herself. Some ladies named Bosanquet, three sisters,
with whom she had become pretty intimate, called
at the Petite Maison Rouge, and carried her off to
their home in the Rue Lamartine, where they had
lived for years. After a very pleasant evening with
them, Lavinia left at ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>And when she reached her own door, and was
putting the latch-key into the lock, the old fear came
over her. Dropping her hands, she stood there
trembling. She looked round at the silent, deserted
yard, she looked up at the high encircling walls; she
glanced at the frosty sky and the bright stars; and
she stood there shivering.</p>

<p>But she must go in. Throwing the door back with
an effort of will, she turned sick and faint: to enter
that dark, lonely, empty house seemed beyond her
strength and courage. What could this strange feeling
portend?&mdash;why should it thus attack her? It was
just as if some fatality were in the house waiting to
destroy her, and a subtle power would keep her from
entering it.</p>

<p>Her heart beating wildly, her breath laboured,
Lavinia went in; she shut the door behind her and
sped up the passage. Feeling for the match-box on
the slab, put ready to her hand, she struck a match
and lighted the candle. At that moment, when turning
round, she saw, or thought she saw, Captain Fennel.
He was standing just within the front-door, which she
had now come in at, staring at her with a fixed gaze,
and with the most malignant expression on his usually
impassive face. Lavinia&rsquo;s terror partly gave place to
astonishment. Was it he himself? How had he
come in?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning to take the candle from the slab in her
bewilderment, when she looked again he was gone.
What had become of him? Lavinia called to him by
name, but he did not answer. She took the candle
into the salon, though feeling sure he could not have
come up the passage; but he was not there. Had he
slipped out again? Had she left the door open when
thinking she closed it, and had he followed her in, and
was now gone again? Lavinia carried her lighted
candle to the door, and found it was fastened. She
had <em>not</em> left it open.</p>

<p>Then, as she undressed in her room, trying all the
while to solve the problem, an idea crept into her
mind that the appearance might have been supernatural.
Yet&mdash;supernatural visitants of the living do
not appear to us, but of the dead. Was Edwin Fennel
dead?</p>

<p>So disturbed was the brain of Lavinia Preen that she
could not get to sleep; but tossed and turned about
the bed almost until daybreak. At six o&rsquo;clock she fell
into an uneasy slumber, and into a most distressing
dream.</p>

<p>It was a confused dream; nothing in it was clear.
All she knew when she awoke, was that she had
appeared to be in a state of inexplicable terror, of
most intense apprehension throughout it, arising from
some evil threatened her by Captain Fennel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>It was a fine, frosty day, and the first of December.
The sun shone on the fair streets of Sainteville and on
the small congregation turning out of the English
Protestant Church after morning service.</p>

<p>Lavinia Preen went straight home. There she
found that Madame Carimon, who was to spend the
rest of the day with her&mdash;monsieur having gone to
Lille&mdash;had not yet arrived, though the French Church
Evangélique was always over before the English.
After glancing at Flore in the kitchen, busy over
the fine ducks, Lavinia set off for the Rue Pomme
Cuite.</p>

<p>She met Mary Carimon turning out of it. &ldquo;Let us
go and sit under the wall in the sun,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;It
is too early yet for the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a high wall belonging to the strong north
gates of the town, near Madame Carimon&rsquo;s. The sun
shone full upon the benches beneath it, which it
sheltered from the bleak winds; in front was a patch
of green grass, on which the children ran about amidst
the straight poplar trees. It was very pleasant sitting
there, even on this December day&mdash;bright and cheerful;
the wall behind them was quite warm, the sunshine
rested upon all.</p>

<p>Sitting there, Lavinia Preen told Madame Carimon
of the curious dread of entering her house at night,
which had pursued her for the past two months that
she had been alone in it, and which she had never
spoken of to any one before. She went on to speak
of the belief that she had seen Captain Fennel the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
previous night in the passage, and of the dream which
had visited her when at length she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Madame Carimon turned her kindly, sensible face
and her quiet, dark, surprised eyes upon Lavinia. &ldquo;I
cannot understand you,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean, I suppose, that you cannot understand
the facts, Mary. Neither can I. Why this fear of
going into the house should lie upon me is most
strange. I never was nervous before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that that is so very strange,&rdquo; dissented
Mary Carimon, after a pause. &ldquo;It must seem
lonely to let one&rsquo;s self into a dark, empty house in
the middle of the night; and your house is in what
may be called an isolated situation; I should not
much like it myself. That&rsquo;s nothing. What I cannot
understand, Lavinia, is the fancy that you saw Captain
Fennel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He appeared to be standing there, and was quite
visible to me. The expression on his face, which
seemed to be looking straight into mine, was most
malicious. I never saw such an expression upon it in
reality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Carimon laughed a little, saying she had never
been troubled with nervous fears herself; she was too
practical for anything of the sort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I have been practical hitherto,&rdquo; returned
Lavinia. &ldquo;When the first surprise of seeing him
there, or fancying I saw him there, was over, I began
to think, Mary, that he might be dead; that it was
his apparition which had stood there looking at
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Carimon shook her head. &ldquo;Had anything of
that sort happened, Nancy would have telegraphed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
you. Rely upon it, Lavinia, it was pure fancy. You
have been disagreeably exercised in mind lately, you
know, about that man; hearing he was coming home,
your brain was somewhat thrown off its balance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be so. The dream followed on it; and I
did not like the dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all have bad dreams now and then. You say
you do not remember much of this one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I did not know much of it when dreaming
it,&rdquo; quaintly spoke Lavinia. &ldquo;I was in a sea of
trouble, throughout which I seemed to be striving to
escape some evil menaced me by Captain Fennel, and
could not do so. Whichever way I turned, there he
was at a distance, scowling at me with a threatening,
evil countenance. Mary,&rdquo; she added in impassioned
tones, &ldquo;I am sure some ill awaits me from that
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure, were I you, I would put these foolish
notions from me,&rdquo; calmly spoke Madame Carimon.
&ldquo;If Nancy set up a vocation for seeing ghosts and
dreaming dreams, one would not so much wonder at
it. <em>You</em> have always been reasonable, Lavinia; be so
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Preen took out her watch and looked at it.
&ldquo;We may as well be walking towards the port, Mary,&rdquo;
she remarked. &ldquo;It is past two. The boat ought to
be in sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not only in sight was the steamer, but rapidly
nearing the port. She had made a calm and quick
passage. When at length she was in and about to
swing round, and the two ladies were looking down at
it, with a small crowd of other assembled spectators,
the first passengers they saw on board were Nancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and Captain Fennel, who began to wave their hands
in greeting and to nod their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any way, Lavinia, it could not have been his
ghost last night,&rdquo; whispered Mary Carimon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Far from presenting an evil countenance to Lavinia,
as the days passed on, Captain Fennel appeared to wish
to please her, and was all suavity. So at present nothing
disturbed the peace of the Petite Maison Rouge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What people were they that you stayed with in
London, Nancy?&rdquo; Lavinia inquired of her sister on
the first favourable opportunity.</p>

<p>Nancy glanced round the salon before answering, as
if to make sure they were alone; but Captain Fennel
had gone out for a stroll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were at James Fennel&rsquo;s, Lavinia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;the brother&rsquo;s! And has he a wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; a wife, but no children. Mrs. James Fennel
has money of her own, which she receives weekly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Receives weekly!&rdquo; echoed Lavinia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She owns some little houses which are let out in
weekly tenements; an agent collects the rents, and
brings her the money every Tuesday morning. She
dresses in the shabbiest things sometimes, and does
her own housework, and altogether is not what I
should call quite a lady, but she is very good-hearted.
She did her best to make us comfortable, and never
grumbled at our staying so long. I expect Edwin
paid her something. James only came home by fits
and starts. I think he was in some embarrassment&mdash;debt,
you know. He used to dash into the house like
a whirlwind when he did come, and steal out of it
when he left, peering about on all sides.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they a nice house?&rdquo; asked Lavinia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, good gracious, no! It&rsquo;s not a house at all,
only small lodgings. And Mrs. James changed them
twice over whilst we were there. When we first
went they were at a place called Ball&rsquo;s Pond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you remain all that time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Edwin Fennel shook her head helplessly; she
could not answer the question. &ldquo;I should have liked
to come back before,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it was very wearisome,
knowing nobody and having nothing to do.
Did you find it dull here, Lavinia, all by yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dull&rsquo; is not the right word for it,&rdquo; answered
Lavinia, catching her breath with a sigh. &ldquo;I felt
more lonely, Ann, than I shall ever care to feel again.
Especially when I had to come home at night from
some soirée, or from spending the evening quietly
with Mary Carimon or any other friend.&rdquo; And she
went on to tell of the feeling of terror which had so
tried her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard of such a thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Ann.
&ldquo;How silly you must be, Lavinia! What could there
have been in the house to frighten you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I wish I did know,&rdquo; sighed Lavinia,
just as she had said more than once before.</p>

<p>Nancy, who was attired in a bright ruby cashmere
robe, with a gold chain and locket, some blue ribbons
adorning her light ringlets, for she had made a point
of dressing more youthfully than ever since her
marriage, leaned back in her chair, as she sat staring
at her sister and thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lavinia,&rdquo; she said huskily, &ldquo;you remember the
feeling you had the day we were about to look at the
house with Mary Carimon, and which you thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
was through the darkness of the passage striking you
unpleasantly? Well, my opinion is that it must have
given you a scare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course it did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I mean a scare which lasts,&rdquo; said Ann;
&ldquo;one of those scares which affect the mind and take
very long to get rid of. You recollect poor Mrs. Hunt,
at Buttermead? She was frightened at a violent
thunderstorm, though she never had been before; and
for years afterwards, whenever it thundered, she
became so alarmingly ill and agitated that Mr.
Featherston had to be run for. He called it a scare.
I think the fear you felt that past day must have left
that sort of scare upon you. How else can you
account for what you tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Truth to say, the same idea had more than once
struck Lavinia. She knew how devoid of reason some
of these &ldquo;scares&rdquo; are, and yet how terribly they disturb
the mind on which they fasten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I had quite forgotten that fear, Ann,&rdquo; she
urged in reply. &ldquo;We had lived in the house eighteen
months when you went away, and I had never
recalled it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the same, I think you received the scare; it
had only lain dormant,&rdquo; persisted Ann.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well; you are back again now, and it is
over,&rdquo; said Lavinia. &ldquo;Let us forget it. Do not speak
of it again at all to any one, Nancy love.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>Winter that year had quite set in when Sainteville
found itself honoured with rather a remarkable visitor;
one Signor Talcke, who descended, one morning at
the beginning of December, at the Hôtel des Princes.
Though he called himself &ldquo;Signor,&rdquo; it seemed uncertain
to what country he owed his birth. He spoke
five or six languages as a native, including Hindustani.
Signor Talcke was a professor of occult sciences; he was
a great astronomer; astrology he had at his fingers&rsquo;
ends. He was a powerful mesmerist; he would foretell
the events of your life by your hands, or your
fortune by the cards.</p>

<p>For a fee of twenty-five francs, he would attend
an evening party, and exhibit some of his powers.
Amidst others who engaged him were the Miss
Bosanquets, in the Rue Lamartine. A relative of
theirs, Sir George Bosanquet, K.C.B., had come over
with his wife to spend Christmas with them. Sir
George laughed at what he heard of Signor Talcke&rsquo;s
powers of reading the future, and said he should much
like to witness a specimen of it. So Miss Bosanquet
and her sisters hastily arranged an evening entertainment,
engaged the mystical man, and invited their
friends and acquaintances, those of the Petite Maison
Rouge included.</p>

<p>It took place on the Friday after Christmas-Day.
Something that occurred during the evening was
rather remarkable. Miss Preen&rsquo;s diary gives a full
account of it, and that shall be transcribed here. And
I, Johnny Ludlow, take this opportunity of assuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the reader that what she wrote was in faithful accordance
with the facts of the case.</p>


<h4>From Miss Preen&rsquo;s Diary.</h4>

<p><i>Saturday morning.</i>&mdash;I feel very tired; fit for
nothing. Nancy has undertaken to do the marketing,
and is gone out for that purpose with her
husband. It is to be hoped she will be moderate,
and not attempt to buy up half the market.</p>

<p>I lay awake all night, after the evening at Miss
Bosanquet&rsquo;s, thinking how foolish Ann was to have
had her &ldquo;future cast,&rdquo; as that Italian (if he is Italian)
called it, and how worse than foolish I was to let
what he said worry me. &ldquo;As if there could be anything
in it!&rdquo; laughed Ann, as we were coming home;
fortunately she is not as I am in temperament&mdash;nervously
anxious. &ldquo;It is only nonsense,&rdquo; said Miss
Anna Bosanquet to me when the signor&rsquo;s predictions
were at an end; &ldquo;he will tell some one else just the
same next time.&rdquo; But <em>I</em> did not think so. Of course,
one is at a loss how to trust this kind of man. Take
him for all in all, I rather like him; and he appears
to believe implicitly in what he says: or, rather, in
what he tell us the cards say.</p>

<p>They are charming women, these three sisters&mdash;Grace,
Rose, and Anna Bosanquet; good, considerate,
high-bred ladies. I wonder how it is they have lived
to middle life without any one of them marrying?
And I often wonder how they came to take up their
residence at Sainteville, for they are very well off, and
have great connections. I remember, though, Anna once
said to me that the dry, pure air of the place suited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
her sister Rose, who has bad health, better than any
other they had tried.</p>

<p>When seven o&rsquo;clock struck, the hour named, Nancy
and I appeared together in the sitting-room, ready to
start, for we observe punctuality at Sainteville. I
wore my black satin, handsome yet, trimmed with the
rich white lace that Mrs. Selby gave me. Nancy
looked very nice and young in her lilac silk. She
wore a white rose in her hair, and her gold chain and
locket round her neck. Captain Fennel surprised us
by saying he was not going&mdash;his neuralgia had come
on. I fancied it was an excuse&mdash;that he did not wish
to meet Sir George Bosanquet. He had complained of
the same thing on Christmas-Day, so it might be true.
Ann and I set off together, leaving him nursing his
cheek at the table.</p>

<p>It was a large gathering for Sainteville&mdash;forty
guests, I should think; but the rooms are large.
Professor Talcke exhibited some wonderful feats in&mdash;what
shall I call it?&mdash;necromancy?&mdash;as good a word,
perhaps, as any other. He mesmerized some people,
and put one of them into a state of clairvoyance, and
her revelations took my breath away. Signor Talcke
assured us that what she said would be found minutely
true. I think he has the strangest eyes I ever saw:
grey eyes, with a sort of light in their depths. His
features are fair and delicate, his voice is gentle as a
woman&rsquo;s, his manner retiring; Sir George seemed
much taken with him.</p>

<p>Later, when the evening was passing, he asked if
any one present would like to have their future cast,
for he had cards which would do it. Three of his
listeners pressed forward at once; two of them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
gay laughter, the other pale and awestruck. The
signor went into the recess in the small room, and
sat down behind the little table there, and as many
as could crowd round to look on, did so. I don&rsquo;t
know what passed; there was no room for me; or
whether the &ldquo;Futures&rdquo; he disclosed were good or bad.
I had sat on the sofa at a distance, talking with Anna
Bosanquet and Madame Carimon.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as we were for a moment silent, Ann&rsquo;s
voice was heard, eager and laughing:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you tell my fortune, Signor Talcke? I should
like to have mine revealed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, madame,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>We got up and drew near. I felt vexed that Ann
should put herself forward in any such matter, and
whispered to her; but she only shook her curls,
laughed at me, and persisted. Signor Talcke put the
cards in her hands, telling her to shuffle them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all fun, Lavinia,&rdquo; she whispered to me. &ldquo;Did
you hear him tell Miss Peet she was going to have
money left her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After Ann had shuffled the cards, he made her cut
them into three divisions, and he then turned them up
on the table himself, faces upwards, and laid them out
in three rows. They were not like the cards we play
with; quite different from those; nearly all were
picture-cards, and the plain ones bore cabalistic
characters. We stood looking on with two or three
other people; the rest had dispersed, and had gone
into the next room to listen to the singing.</p>

<p>At first Signor Talcke never spoke a word. He
looked at the cards, and looked at Nancy; looked, and
looked again. &ldquo;They are not propitious,&rdquo; he said in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
low tones, and picked them up, and asked Nancy to
shuffle and cut them again. Then he laid them as
before, and we stood waiting in silence.</p>

<p>Chancing at that moment to look at Signor Talcke,
his face startled me. He was frowning at the cards
in so painful a manner as to quite alter its expression.
But he did not speak. He still only gazed at the
cards with bent eyes, and glanced up at Ann occasionally.
Then, with an impatient sweep of the hand,
he pushed the cards together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must trouble you to shuffle and cut them once
more, madame,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shuffle them well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they still unpropitious?&rdquo; asked a jesting
voice at my elbow. Turning, I saw Charley Palliser&rsquo;s
smiling face. He must have been standing there, and
heard Signor Talcke&rsquo;s previous remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, they are,&rdquo; replied the signor, with marked
emphasis. &ldquo;I never saw the cards so unpropitious in
my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy took up the cards, shuffled them well, and
cut them three times. Signor Talcke laid them out
as before, bent his head, and looked attentively at
them. He did not speak, but there was no mistaking
the vexed, pained, and puzzled look on his face.</p>

<p>I do not think he knew Nancy, even by name. I
do not think he knew me, or had the least notion that
we were related. Neither of us had ever met him
before. He put his hand to his brow, still gazing at
the cards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when are you going to begin my fortune,
sir?&rdquo; broke in Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather not tell it at all, madame,&rdquo; he
answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Cannot</em> you tell it?&mdash;have your powers of forecasting
inconveniently run away?&rdquo; said she incautiously,
her tone mocking in her disappointment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could tell it, all too surely; but you might not
like to hear it,&rdquo; returned he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our magician has lost his divining-rod just when
he needed it,&rdquo; observed a gentleman with a grey
beard, a stranger to me, who was standing opposite,
speaking in a tone of ill-natured satire; and a laugh
went round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not that,&rdquo; said the signor, keeping his temper
perfectly. &ldquo;I could tell what the cards say, all too
certainly; but it would not give satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, it would,&rdquo; returned Nancy. &ldquo;I should
like to hear it, every bit of it. Please do begin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cards are dark, very dark indeed,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember ever to have seen them like it.
Each time they have been turned the darkness has
increased. <em>Nothing</em> can show worse than they do
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; gaily returned Ann. &ldquo;You
undertook to tell my fortune, sir; and you ought not
to make excuses in the middle of it. Let the cards
be as dark as night, we must hear what they say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew in his thin lips for a moment, and then
spoke, his tone quiet, calm, unemotional.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some great evil threatens you,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;you
seem to be living in the midst of it. It is not only
you that it threatens; there is another also&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my goodness!&rdquo; interrupted Nancy, in her
childish way. &ldquo;I hope it does not threaten Edwin.
What <em>is</em> the evil?&mdash;sickness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse than that. It&mdash;is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Signor Talcke&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
attention was so absorbed by the aspect of the cards
that, as it struck me, he appeared hardly to heed
what he was saying. He had a long, thin black pencil
in his long, thin fingers, and kept pointing to different
cards as if in accordance with his thoughts, but not
touching them. &ldquo;There is some peculiar form of
terror here,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I cannot make it out; it
is very unusual. It does not come close to you; not
yet, at any rate; and it seems to surround you. It
seems to be in the house. May I ask&rdquo;&mdash;quickly
lifting his eyes to Ann&mdash;&ldquo;whether you are given to
superstitious fears?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean ghosts?&rdquo; cried Ann, and Charley
Palliser burst out laughing. &ldquo;Not at all, sir; I don&rsquo;t
believe in ghosts. I&rsquo;m sure there are none in our
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Remembering my own terror in regard to the house,
and the nervous fancy of having seen Captain Fennel
in it when he was miles away, a curious impression
came over me that he must surely be reading my
fortune as well as Nancy&rsquo;s. But I was not prepared
for her next words. Truly she has no more reticence
than a child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sister has a feeling that the house is lonely.
She shivers when she has to go into it after night-fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Signor Talcke let his hands fall on the table, and
lifted his face. Apparently, he was digesting this
revelation. I do not think he knew the &ldquo;sister&rdquo; was
present. For my part, disliking publicity, I slipped
behind Anna Bosanquet, and stood by Charley Palliser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shivers?&rdquo; repeated the Italian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shivers and trembles, and turns sick at having to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
go in,&rdquo; affirmed Nancy. &ldquo;So she told me when I
arrived home from England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a feeling of that sort assailed me, I should never
go into the house again,&rdquo; said the signor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how could you help it, if it were your
home?&rdquo; she argued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the same. I should regard that feeling as a
warning against the house, and never enter it. Then
you are not yourself troubled with superstitious
fears?&rdquo; he broke off, returning to the business in
hand, and looking at the cards. &ldquo;Well&mdash;at present&mdash;it
does not seem to touch you, this curious terror
which is assuredly in the house&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; interrupted Ann. &ldquo;Why do
you say &lsquo;at present&rsquo;? Is it to touch me later?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say. Each time that the cards have been
spread it has shown itself nearer to you. It is not
yet very near. Apart from that terror&mdash;or perhaps
remotely connected with it&mdash;I see evil threatening
you&mdash;great evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it in the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; hovering about it. It is not only yourself it
seems to threaten. There is some one else. And it is
nearer to that person than it is to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who is that person?&mdash;man or woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a woman. See this ugly card,&rdquo; continued
he, pointing with his pencil; &ldquo;it will not be got rid
of, shuffle as you will; it has come nearer to that
woman each time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The card he pointed to was more curious-looking
than any other in the pack. It was not unlike the
nine of spades, but crowded with devices. The
gentleman opposite, whom I did not know, leaned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
forward and touched the card with the tip of his
forefinger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Le cercueil, n&rsquo;est-ce-pas?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My!&rdquo; whispered an English lad&rsquo;s voice behind me.
&ldquo;Cercueil? that means coffin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; asked Signor Talcke of the
grey-bearded man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was at the Sous-Préfect&rsquo;s soirée on Sunday
evening when you were exhibiting. I heard you tell
him in French that that was the ugliest card in the
pack: indicating death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is not this lady the card is pursuing,&rdquo; said
the signor, smiling at Ann to reassure her. &ldquo;Not yet
awhile, at least. And we must all be pursued by it
in our turn, whenever that shall come,&rdquo; he added,
bending over the cards again. &ldquo;Pardon me, madame&mdash;may
I ask whether there has not been some unpleasantness
in the house concerning money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy&rsquo;s face turned red. &ldquo;Not&mdash;exactly,&rdquo; she
answered with hesitation. &ldquo;We are like a great
many more people&mdash;not as rich as we should wish
to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does not appear to lie precisely in the want of
money: but certainly money is in some way connected
with the evil,&rdquo; he was beginning to say, his eyes fixed
dreamily on the cards, when Ann interrupted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is too strong a word&mdash;evil. Why do you
use it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I use it because the evil is there. No lighter
word would be appropriate. There is some evil
element pervading your house, very grave and formidable;
it is most threatening; likely to go on to&mdash;to&mdash;darkness.
I mean that it looks as if there would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
some great break-up,&rdquo; he corrected swiftly, as if to
soften the other word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the house would be broken up?&rdquo; questioned
Ann.</p>

<p>He stole a glance at her. &ldquo;Something of that sort,&rdquo;
he said carelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that the evil comes from an
enemy?&rdquo; she went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Assuredly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we have no enemy. I&rsquo;m sure we have not
one in all the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He slightly shook his head. &ldquo;You may not suspect
it yet, though I should have said&rdquo;&mdash;waving the pencil
thoughtfully over some of the cards&mdash;&ldquo;that he was
already suspected&mdash;doubted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy took up the personal pronoun briskly.
&ldquo;He!&mdash;then the evil enemy must be a man? I
assure you we do not know any man likely to be our
enemy or to wish us harm. No, nor woman either.
Perhaps your cards don&rsquo;t tell true to-night, Signor
Talcke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, madame; we will let it be so if
you will,&rdquo; he quietly said, and shuffled all the cards
together.</p>

<p>That ended the séance. As if determined not to
tell any more fortunes, the signor hurriedly put up
the cards and disappeared from the recess. Nancy
did not appear to be in the least impressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a curious &lsquo;future&rsquo; it was!&rdquo; she exclaimed
lightly to Mary Carimon. &ldquo;I might as well not have
had it cast. He told me nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked away together. I went back to the
sofa and Anna Bosanquet followed me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Fennel calls it &lsquo;curious,&rsquo;&rdquo; I said to her. &ldquo;I
call it more than that&mdash;strange; ominous. I wish I
had not heard it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Miss Preen, it is only nonsense,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;He will tell some one else the same next time.&rdquo; But
she only so spoke to console me.</p>

<p>A wild wish flashed into my mind&mdash;that I should
ask the man to tell <em>my</em> future. But had I not heard
enough? Mine was blended with this of Ann&rsquo;s. <em>I</em>
was the other woman whom the dark fate was more
relentlessly pursuing. There could be no doubt of
that. There could be as little doubt that it was I
who already suspected the author of the &ldquo;evil.&rdquo;
What can the &ldquo;dark fate&rdquo; be that we are threatened
with? Debt? Will his debts spring upon us and
break up our home, and turn us out of it? Or will
it be something worse? That card which followed
me meant a coffin, they said. Ah me! Perhaps I am
foolish to dwell upon such ideas. Certainly they are
more fitting for the world&rsquo;s dark ages than for this
enlightened nineteenth century of it.</p>

<p>Charley Palliser gallantly offered to see us home.
I said no; as if we were not old enough to go by
ourselves; but he would come with us. As we went
along Ann began talking of the party, criticizing the
dresses, and so on. Charley seemed to be unusually
silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was not mine a grand fortune?&rdquo; she presently
said with a laugh, as we crossed the Place Ronde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stunning,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if there could be anything in it, you know!
Does the man think we believe him, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, these conjurers like to fancy they impose on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
us,&rdquo; remarked Charley, shaking hands as we halted
before the house of Madame Sauvage.</p>

<p>And I have had a wretched night, for somehow the
thing has frightened me. I never was superstitious;
never; and I&rsquo;m sure I never believed in conjurers, as
Charles had it. If I should come across Signor Talcke
again while he stays here, I would ask him&mdash;&mdash; Here
comes Nancy! and Flore behind her with the
marketings. I&rsquo;ll put up my diary.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bought such a lovely capon,&rdquo; began Nancy, as
Lavinia went into the kitchen. &ldquo;Show it to madame,
Flore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was one that even Lavinia could praise; they
both understood poultry. &ldquo;It really is a beauty,&rdquo;
said Lavinia. &ldquo;And did you remember the salsifis?
And, Ann, where have you left your husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we met old Mr. Griffin, and Edwin has gone
up to Drecques with him. My opinion is, Lavinia,
that that poor old Griffin dare not go about far by
himself since his attack. He had to see his landlord
at Drecques to-day, and he asked Edwin to accompany
him. They went by the eleven-o&rsquo;clock train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia felt it a relief. Even that little absence,
part of a day, she felt thankful for, so much had she
grown to dislike the presence in the house of Edwin
Fennel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you tell your husband about your &lsquo;fortune&rsquo;
Nancy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I was too sleepy last night to talk, and I
was late in getting up this morning. I&rsquo;m not sure
that I shall tell him,&rdquo; added Mrs. Fennel thoughtfully;
&ldquo;he might be angry with me for having had it done.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is more than likely,&rdquo; replied Lavinia.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, as they were sitting together
in the salon, they saw the postman come marching up
the yard. He brought two letters&mdash;one for Miss
Preen, the other for her sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the remittance from William Selby,&rdquo; said
Lavinia as she opened hers. &ldquo;He has sent it a day
or two earlier than usual; it is not really due until
Monday or Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seventeen pounds ten shillings each. Nancy, in
a hasty sort of manner, put her cheque into the hands
of Lavinia, almost as if she feared it would burn her
own fingers. &ldquo;You had better take it from me whilst
you can,&rdquo; she said in low tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; for I must have it, Ann,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;We are in debt&mdash;as you may readily conceive&mdash;with
only half the usual amount to spend last quarter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not my fault; I was very sorry,&rdquo; said Ann
humbly; and she rose hastily to go to the kitchen,
saying she was thirsty, and wanted a glass of water.
But Lavinia thought she went to avoid being questioned.</p>

<p>Lavinia carried the two cheques to her room and
locked them up. After their five-o&rsquo;clock dinner, each
sister wrote a note to Colonel Selby, enclosing her
receipt. Flore took them out to post when she left.
The evening passed on. Lavinia worked; Nancy
nodded over the fire: she was very sleepy, and went
to bed early.</p>

<p>It was past eleven o&rsquo;clock when Captain Fennel
came in, a little the worse for something or other.
After returning from Drecques by the last train, he
had gone home with Mr. Griffin to supper. He told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Lavinia, in words running into one another, that the
jolting train had made him giddy. Of course she
believed as much of that as she liked, but did not
contradict it. He went to the cupboard in the recess,
unlocked it to get out the cognac, and then sat down
with his pipe by the embers of the dying fire. Lavinia,
unasked, brought in a decanter of water, put it on the
table with a glass, and wished him good-night.</p>

<p>All next day Captain Fennel lay in bed with a
racking headache. His wife carried up a choice bit
of the capon when they were dining after morning
service, but he could not so much as look at it. Being
a fairly cautious man as a rule, he had to pay for&mdash;for
the jolting of the train.</p>

<p>He was better on Monday morning, but not well,
still shaky, and did not come down to breakfast. It
was bitterly cold&mdash;a sort of black frost; but Lavinia,
wrapping herself up warmly, went out as soon as
breakfast was over.</p>

<p>Her first errand was to the bank, where she paid in
the cheques and received French money for them.
Then she visited sundry shops; the butcher&rsquo;s, the
grocer&rsquo;s, and others, settling the accounts due. Last
of all, she made a call upon Madame Veuve Sauvage,
and paid the rent for the past quarter. All this left
her with exactly nineteen pounds, which was all the
money she had to go on with for every purpose until
the end of March&mdash;three whole months.</p>

<p>Lunch was ready when she returned. Taking off
her things upstairs and locking up her cash, she went
down to it. Flore had made some delicious soupe
maigre. Only those who have tried it know how
good it is on a sharp winter&rsquo;s day. Captain Fennel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
seemed to relish it much, though his appetite had not
quite come back to him, and he turned from the dish
of scrambled eggs which supplemented the soup. In
the evening they went, by appointment, to dine at
Madame Carimon&rsquo;s, the other guests being Monsieur
Henri Dupuis with his recently married wife, and
Charles Palliser.</p>

<p>After dinner, over the coffee, Monsieur Henri
Dupuis suddenly spoke of the soirée at Miss Bosanquet&rsquo;s
the previous Friday, regretting that he and his
wife had been unable to attend it. He was engaged
the whole evening with a patient dangerously ill,
and his wife did not like to appear at it without
him. Nancy&mdash;Nancy!&mdash;then began to tell about the
&ldquo;fortune&rdquo; which had been forecast for her by Signor
Talcke, thinking possibly that her husband could not
reproach her for it before company. She was very
gay over it; a proof that it had left no bad impression
on her mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Nancy?&rdquo; cried Captain Fennel, who
had listened as if he disbelieved his ears. &ldquo;The fellow
told you we had something evil in our house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did,&rdquo; assented Nancy. &ldquo;An evil influence,
he said, which was destined to bring forth something
dark and dreadful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you did not tell this before,&rdquo; returned
the captain stiffly. &ldquo;I should have requested you
not again to allude to such folly. It was downright
insolence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;you&mdash;you were out on Saturday, you know,
Edwin, and in bed with your headache all Sunday;
and to-day I forgot it,&rdquo; said Nancy in less brave
tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we have a game at wholesome card-playing,&rdquo;
interposed Mary Carimon, bringing forth a
new pack. &ldquo;Open them, will you, Jules? Do you
remember, mon ami, having your fortune told once by
a gipsy woman when we were in Sir John Whitney&rsquo;s
coppice with the two Peckham girls? She told you
you would fall into a rich inheritance and marry a
Frenchwoman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither of which agreeable promises is yet fulfilled,&rdquo;
said little Monsieur Carimon with his happy
smile. Monsieur Carimon had heard the account of
Nancy&rsquo;s &ldquo;forecast&rdquo; from his wife; he was not himself
present, but taking a hand at whist in the card-room.</p>

<p>They sat down to a round game&mdash;spin. Monsieur
Henri Dupuis and his pretty young wife had never
played it before, but they soon learned it and liked it
much. Both of them spoke English well; she with
the prettiest accent imaginable. Thus the evening
passed, and no more allusion was made to the fortune-telling
at Miss Bosanquet&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>That was Monday. On Tuesday, Miss Preen was
dispensing the coffee at breakfast in the Petite Maison
Rouge to her sister and Mr. Fennel, when Flore came
bustling in with a letter in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tenez, madame,&rdquo; she said, putting it beside Mrs.
Fennel. &ldquo;I laid it down in the kitchen when the
facteur brought it, whilst I was preparing the déjeûner,
and forgot it afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Nancy could touch the letter, her husband
caught it up. He gazed at the address, at the postmark,
and turned it about to look at the seal. The
letters of gentlefolk were generally fastened with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
seal in those days: this had one in transparent bronze
wax.</p>

<p>Mr. Fennel put the letter down with a remark
peevishly uttered. &ldquo;It is not from London; it is from
Buttermead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And from your old friend, Jane Peckham, Nancy,&rdquo;
struck in Lavinia. &ldquo;I recognize her handwriting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>am</em> glad,&rdquo; exclaimed Nancy. &ldquo;I have not heard
from them for ages. Why now&mdash;is it not odd?&mdash;that
Madame Carimon should mention the Peckhams
last night, and I receive a letter from them this
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I supposed it might be from London, with your
remittance,&rdquo; said Mr. Fennel to his wife. &ldquo;It is due,
is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that came on Saturday, Edwin,&rdquo; she said, as
she opened her letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Came on Saturday!&rdquo; echoed Captain Fennel ungraciously,
as if disputing the assertion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the afternoon post; you were at Drecques,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>money</em> came? <em>Your</em> money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Nancy, who had stepped to the window
to read her letter, for it was a dark day, and stood
there with her back to the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where is it?&rdquo; demanded he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave it to Lavinia. I always give it to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Fennel glared at his wife for a moment,
then smoothed his face to its ordinary placidity, and
turned to Lavinia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be good enough to hand over to me my
wife&rsquo;s money, Miss Preen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I must trouble you to do so, when breakfast shall
be finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; pursued Lavinia. &ldquo;I have paid it
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I do not believe. I claim it from you in
right of my wife; and I shall enforce the claim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The money is Nancy&rsquo;s, not yours,&rdquo; said Lavinia.
&ldquo;In consequence of your having stopped her share
last quarter in London, I was plunged here into debt
and great inconvenience. Yesterday morning I went
out to settle the debts&mdash;and it has taken the whole of
her money to do it. That is the state of things,
Captain Fennel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am in debt here myself,&rdquo; retorted he, but not
angrily. &ldquo;I owe money to my tailor and bootmaker;
I owe an account at the chemist&rsquo;s; I want money in
my pockets&mdash;and I must indeed have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not from me,&rdquo; returned Lavinia.</p>

<p>Edwin Fennel broke into a little access of temper.
He dashed his serviette on the table, strode to the
window, and roughly caught his wife by the arm.
She cried out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dared you hand your money to any one but
me?&rdquo; he asked in a low voice of passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how are we to live if I don&rsquo;t give it to
Lavinia for the housekeeping?&rdquo; returned Nancy,
bursting into tears. &ldquo;It takes all we have; her
share and mine; every farthing of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let my sister alone, Mr. Fennel,&rdquo; spoke up Lavinia
with authority. &ldquo;She is responsible for the debts we
contract in this house, just as much as I am, and she
must contribute her part to pay them. You ought to
be aware that the expenses are now increased by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
nearly a third; I assure you I hardly like to face the
difficulties I see before me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose I can stop in the place without
some loose cash to keep me going?&rdquo; he asked calmly.
&ldquo;Is that reasonable, Miss Lavinia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you suppose I can keep you and Ann here
without her money to help me to do it?&rdquo; she rejoined.
&ldquo;Perhaps the better plan will be for me to take up
my abode elsewhere, and leave the house to you and
Ann to do as you please in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Fennel dropped his argument, returned to
the table, and went on with his breakfast. The last
words had startled him. Without Lavinia, which
meant without her money, they could not live in the
house at all.</p>

<p>Matters were partly patched up in the course of the
day. Nancy came upstairs to Lavinia, begging and
praying, as if she were praying for her life, for a little
ready money for her husband&mdash;just a hundred francs.
Trembling and sobbing, she confessed that she dared
not return to him without it; she should be too
frightened at his anger.</p>

<p>And Lavinia gave it to her.</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>Matters went on to the spring. There were no
outward differences in the Petite Maison Rouge, but
it was full of an undercurrent of discomfort. At least
for Lavinia. Captain Fennel was simply to her an
incubus; and now and again petty accounts of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
would be brought to the door by tradespeople who
wanted them settled. As to keeping up the legitimate
payments, she could not do it.</p>

<p>March was drawing to an end, when a surprise
came to them. Lavinia received a letter from Paris,
written by Colonel Selby. He had been there for
two days on business, he said, and purposed returning
viâ Sainteville, to take a passing glimpse at herself
and her sister. He hoped to be down that afternoon
by the three-o&rsquo;clock train, and he asked them to meet
him at the Hôtel des Princes afterwards, and to stay
and dine with him. He proposed crossing to London
by the night boat.</p>

<p>Lavinia read the letter aloud. Nancy went into
ecstasies, for a wonder; she had been curiously
subdued in manner lately. Edwin Fennel made no
remark, but his pale face wore a look of thought.</p>

<p>During the morning he betook himself to the Rue
Lothaire to call upon Mr. Griffin; and he persuaded
that easy-natured old gentleman to take advantage
of the sunny day and make an excursion en voiture
to the nearest town, a place called Pontipette. Of
course the captain went also, as his companion.</p>

<p>Colonel Selby arrived at three. Lavinia and
Nancy met him at the station, and went with him in
the omnibus to the hotel. They then showed him
about Sainteville, to which he was a stranger, took
him to see their domicile, the little red house (which
he did not seem to admire), and thence to Madame
Carimon&rsquo;s. In the Buttermead days, the colonel and
Mary Featherston had been great friends. He invited
her and her husband to join them at the table d&rsquo;hôte
dinner at five o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Lavinia and Nancy went home again to change
their dresses for it. Nancy put on a pretty light
green silk, which had been recently modernized. Mrs.
Selby had kept up an extensive wardrobe, and had
left it between the two sisters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should wear your gold chain and locket,&rdquo;
remarked Lavinia, who always took pride in her
sister&rsquo;s appearance. &ldquo;It will look very nice upon
that dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She alluded to a short, thick chain of gold, the gold
locket attached to it being set round with pearls,
Nancy&rsquo;s best ornament; nay, the only one she had of
any value; it was the one she had worn at Miss
Bosanquet&rsquo;s celebrated party. Nancy made no answer.
She was turning red and white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; cried Lavinia.</p>

<p>The matter was, that Mr. Edwin Fennel had obtained
possession of the chain and locket more than a month
ago. Silly Nancy confessed with trembling lips that
she feared he had pledged it.</p>

<p>Or sold it, thought Lavinia. She felt terribly vexed
and indignant. &ldquo;I suppose, Ann, it will end in his
grasping everything,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and starving us out
of house and home: <em>myself</em>, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He expects money from his brother James, and
then he will get it back for me,&rdquo; twittered Nancy.</p>

<p>Monsieur Jules Carimon was not able to come to
the table d&rsquo;hôte; his duties that night would detain
him at the college until seven o&rsquo;clock. It happened
so on occasion. Colonel Selby sat at one end of their
party, Lavinia at the other; Mary Carimon and Nancy
between them. A gentleman was on the other side of
Lavinia whom she did not particularly notice; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
upon his asking the waiter for something, his voice
seemed to strike upon her memory. Turning, she saw
that it was the tall Englishman they had seen on the
pier some months before in the shepherd&rsquo;s plaid, the
lawyer named Lockett. He recognized her face at
the same moment, and they entered into conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you making any stay at Sainteville?&rdquo; she
inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a few days. I must be back in London on
Monday morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colonel Selby&rsquo;s attention was attracted to the
speakers. &ldquo;What, is it you, Lockett?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mr. Lockett bent forward to look beyond Lavinia
and Madame Carimon. &ldquo;Why, colonel, are you here?&rdquo;
he cried. So it was evident that they knew one
another.</p>

<p>But you can&rsquo;t talk very much across people at a
table d&rsquo;hôte; and Lavinia and Mr. Lockett were, so to
say, left together again. She put a question to him,
dropping her voice to a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever find that person you were looking
for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The person I was looking for?&rdquo; repeated the
lawyer, not remembering. &ldquo;What person was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one you spoke of on the pier that day&mdash;a
Mr. Dangerfield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ay; but I was not looking for him myself.
No; I believe he is not dropped upon yet. He is
keeping quiet, I expect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he still being looked for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little doubt of that. My friend here, on my left,
could tell you more about him than I can, if you want
to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Lavinia hastily, in a sort of
fear. And she then observed that next to Mr. Lockett
another Englishman was sitting, who looked very
much like a lawyer also.</p>

<p>After dinner Colonel Selby took his guests, the
three ladies, into the little salon, which opened to
Madame Podevin&rsquo;s bureau; for it was she who, French
fashion, kept the bureau and all its accounts, not her
husband. Whilst the coffee which the colonel ordered
was preparing, he took from his pocket-book two
cheques, and gave one each to Lavinia and Mrs.
Fennel. It was their quarterly income, due about a
week hence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I might as well give it you now, as I
am here, and save the trouble of sending,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;You can write me a receipt for it; here&rsquo;s
pen, ink and paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each wrote her receipt, and gave it him. Nancy
held the cheque in her hand, looking at her sister in a
vacillating manner. &ldquo;I suppose I ought to give it
you, Lavinia,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Must I do so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think about it yourself?&rdquo; coldly
rejoined Lavinia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was so very angry with me the last time,&rdquo;
sighed Nancy, still withholding the cheque. &ldquo;He said
I ought to keep possession of my own, and he ordered
me to do so in future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That he may have the pleasure of spending it,&rdquo;
said Mary Carimon in a sharp tone, though she laughed
at the same time. &ldquo;Lavinia has to pay for the bread-and-cheese
that you and he eat, Nancy; how can she
do that unless she receives your money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know; it is very difficult,&rdquo; said poor Nancy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
&ldquo;Take the cheque, Lavinia; I shall tell him that you
and Mary Carimon both said I must give it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell him I said so, and welcome,&rdquo; spoke
Madame Carimon. &ldquo;I will tell him so myself, if you
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Colonel Selby returned to the room&mdash;he had
been seeing to his luggage&mdash;the coffee was brought in,
and close upon it came Monsieur Carimon.</p>

<p>The boat for London was leaving early that night&mdash;eight
o&rsquo;clock; they all went down to it to see
William Selby off. It was a calm night, warm for the
time of year, the moon beautifully bright. After the
boat&rsquo;s departure, Lavinia and Ann went home, and
found Captain Fennel there. He had just got in, he
said, and wanted some supper.</p>

<p>Whilst he was taking it, his wife told him of Mr.
Lockett&rsquo;s having sat by them at the table d&rsquo;hôte, and
that he and Colonel Selby were acquainted with one
another. Captain Fennel drew a grim face at the
information, and asked whether the lawyer had also
&ldquo;cleared out&rdquo; for London.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so; I did not see him go on board,&rdquo;
said Nancy. &ldquo;Lavinia knows; she was talking with
Mr. Lockett all dinner-time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Fennel turned his impassive face to Lavinia,
as if demanding an answer to his question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lockett intends to remain here until Sunday,
I fancy; he said he had to be in London on Monday
morning. He has some friend with him here. I
inquired whether they had found the Mr. Dangerfield
he spoke of last autumn,&rdquo; added Lavinia slowly and
distinctly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Not yet,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;but he is still
being looked for.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether Lavinia said this with a little spice of
malice, or whether she really meant to warn him, she
best knew. Captain Fennel finished his supper in
silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume the colonel did not hand you over your
quarter&rsquo;s money?&rdquo; he next said to his wife in a mocking
sort of way. &ldquo;It is not due for a week yet; he is
not one to pay beforehand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon which Nancy began to tremble and looked
imploringly at her sister, who was putting the plates
together upon the tray. After Flore went home they
had to wait upon themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colonel Selby did hand us the money,&rdquo; said
Lavinia. &ldquo;I hold both cheques for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, there ensued a mild disturbance; what schoolboys
might call a genteel row. Mr. Edwin Fennel
insisted upon his wife&rsquo;s cheque being given to him.
Lavinia decisively refused. She went into a bit of a
temper, and told him some home truths. He said he
had a right to hold his wife&rsquo;s money, and should
appeal to the law on the morrow to enforce it. He
might do that, Lavinia retorted; no French law would
make her give it up. Nancy began to cry.</p>

<p>Probably he knew his threats were futile. Instead
of appealing to the law on the morrow, he went off by
an early train, carrying Nancy with him. Lavinia&rsquo;s
private opinion was that he thought it safer to take
her, though it did increase the expense, than to leave
her; she might get talking with Mr. Lockett. Ann&rsquo;s
eyes were red, as if she had spent the night in
crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he <em>beaten</em> you?&rdquo; Lavinia inquired, snatching
the opportunity of a private moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lavinia, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t! I shall <em>never</em> dare to let
you have the cheque again,&rdquo; she wailed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is it that you are going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has not told me,&rdquo; Nancy whispered back again.
&ldquo;To Calais, I think, or else up to Lille. We are to be
away all the week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until Mr. Lockett and his friend are gone,&rdquo;
thought Lavinia. &ldquo;Nancy, how can he find money
for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has some napoleons in his pocket&mdash;borrowed
yesterday, I think, from old Griffin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia understood. Old Griffin, as Nancy styled
him, had been careless of his money since his very
slight attack of paralysis; he would freely lend to
any one who asked him. She had not the slightest
doubt that Captain Fennel had borrowed of him&mdash;and
not for the first time.</p>

<p>It was on Wednesday morning that they went
away, and for the rest of the week Lavinia was at
peace. She changed the cheques at the bank as
before, and paid the outstanding debts. But it left
her so little to go on with, that she really knew not
how she should get through the months until midsummer.</p>

<p>On Friday two of the Miss Bosanquets called.
Hearing she was alone, they came to ask her to dine
with them in the evening. Lavinia did so. But upon
returning home at night, the old horror of going into
the house came on again. Lavinia was in despair;
she had hoped it had passed away for good.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning at market she met Madame
Carimon, who invited her for the following day,
Sunday. Lavinia hesitated. Glad enough indeed she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
was at the prospect of being taken out of her solitary
home for a happy day at Mary Carimon&rsquo;s; but she
shrank from again risking the dreadful feeling which
would be sure to attack her when going into the
house at night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must come, Lavinia,&rdquo; cheerily urged Madame
Carimon. &ldquo;I have invited the English teacher at
Madame Deauville&rsquo;s school; she has no friends here,
poor thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I will come, Mary; thank you,&rdquo; said Lavinia
slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure you will. Why do you hesitate at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia could not say why in the midst of the
jostling market-place; perhaps would not had they
been alone. &ldquo;For one thing, they may be coming
home before to-morrow,&rdquo; observed Lavinia, alluding
to Mr. and Mrs. Fennel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them come. You are not obliged to stay at
home with them,&rdquo; laughed Mary.</p>


<h4>From the Diary of Miss Preen.</h4>

<p><i>Monday morning.</i>&mdash;Well, it is over. The horror of
last night is over, and I have not died of it. That
will be considered a strong expression, should any eye
save my own see this diary: but I truly believe the
horror would kill me if I were subjected many more
times to it.</p>

<p>I went to Mary Carimon&rsquo;s after our service was
over in the morning, and we had a pleasant day there.
The more I see of Monsieur Jules the more I esteem
and respect him. He is so genuine, so good at heart,
so simple in manner. Miss Perry is very agreeable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
not so young as I had thought&mdash;thirty last birthday,
she says. Her English is good and refined, and that
is not always the case with the English teachers who
come over to France&mdash;the French ladies who engage
them cannot judge of our accent.</p>

<p>Miss Perry and I left together a little before ten.
She wished me good-night in the Rue Tessin, Madame
Deauville&rsquo;s house lying one way, mine another. The
horror began to come over me as I crossed the Place
Ronde, which had never happened before. Stay; not
the horror itself, but the dread of it. An impulse
actually crossed me to ring at Madame Sauvage&rsquo;s, and
ask Mariette to accompany me up the entry, and
stand at my open door whilst I went in to light the
candle. But I could see no light in the house, not
even in madame&rsquo;s salon, and supposed she and Mariette
might be gone to bed. They are early people on
Sundays, and the two young men have their latch-keys.</p>

<p>I will try to overcome it this time, I bravely said
to myself, and not allow the fear to keep me halting
outside the door as it has done before. So I took out
my latch-key, put it straight into the door, opened it,
went in, and closed it again. Before I had well
reached the top of the passage and felt for the match-box
on the slab, I was in a paroxysm of horror.
Something, like an icy wind coming up the passage,
seemed to flutter the candle as I lighted it. Can I
have left the door open? I thought, and turned to
look. There stood Edwin Fennel. He stood just
inside the door, which appeared to be shut, and he
was looking straight at me with a threatening,
malignant expression on his pale face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! have you come home to-night?&rdquo; I exclaimed
aloud. For I really thought it was so.</p>

<p>The candle continued to flicker quickly as if it
meant to go out, causing me to glance at it. When I
looked up again Mr. Fennel was gone. <em>It was not
himself who had been there; it was only an illusion.</em></p>

<p>Exactly as he had seemed to appear to me the night
before he and Nancy returned from London in December,
so he had appeared again, his back to the door,
and the evil menace on his countenance. Did the
appearance come to me as a warning? or was the
thing nothing but a delusion of my own optic nerves?</p>

<p>I dragged my shaking limbs upstairs, on the verge
of screaming at each step with the fear of what might
be behind me, and undressed and went to bed. For
nearly the whole night I could not sleep, and when I
did get to sleep in the morning I was tormented by a
distressing dream. All, all as it had been that other
night from three to four months ago.</p>

<p>A confused dream, no method in it. Several people
were about&mdash;Nancy for one; I saw her fair curls.
We all seemed to be in grievous discomfort and distress;
whilst I, in worse fear than this world can
know, was ever striving to hide myself from Edwin
Fennel, to escape some dreadful fate which he held in
store for me. And I knew I should not escape it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>


<h3>X.</h3>

<p>Like many another active housewife, Madame
Carimon was always busy on Monday mornings. On
the one about to be referred to, she had finished her
household duties by eleven o&rsquo;clock, and then sat down
in her little salle-à-manger, which she also made her
workroom, to mend some of Monsieur Carimon&rsquo;s
cotton socks. By her side, on the small work-table,
lay a silver brooch which Miss Perry had inadvertently
left behind her the previous evening. Mary Carimon
was considering at what hour she could most conveniently
go out to leave it at Madame Deauville&rsquo;s
when she heard Pauline answer a ring at the door-bell,
and Miss Preen came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lavinia, I am glad to see you. You are an
early visitor. Are you not well?&rdquo; continued Madame
Carimon, noticing the pale, sad face. &ldquo;Is anything
the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am in great trouble, Mary; I cannot rest; and
I have come to talk to you about it,&rdquo; said Lavinia,
taking the sable boa from her neck and untying her
bonnet-strings. &ldquo;If things were to continue as they
are now, I should die of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drawing a chair near to Mary Carimon, Lavinia
entered upon her narrative. She spoke first of general
matters. The home discomfort, the trouble with
Captain Fennel regarding Nancy&rsquo;s money, and the
difficulty she had to keep up the indispensable payments
to the tradespeople, expressing her firm belief
that in future he would inevitably seize upon Nancy&rsquo;s
portion when it came and confiscate it. Next, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
went on to tell the story of the past night&mdash;Sunday:
how the old terrible horror had come upon her of
entering the house, of a fancied appearance of Edwin
Fennel in the passage, and of the dream that followed.
All this latter part was but a repetition of what she
had told Madame Carimon three or four months ago.
Hearing it for the second time, it impressed Mary Carimon&rsquo;s
imagination. But she did not speak at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never in my life saw anything plainer or that
looked more life-like than Captain Fennel, as he stood
and gazed at me from the end of the passage with
the evil look on his countenance,&rdquo; resumed Lavinia.
&ldquo;And I hardly know why I tell you about it again,
Mary, except that I have no one else to speak to.
You rather laughed at me the first time, if you
remember; perhaps you will laugh again now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; dissented Mary Carimon. &ldquo;I did not
put faith in it before, believing you were deceived by
the uncertain light in the passage, and were, perhaps,
thinking of him, and that the dream afterwards was
merely the result of your fright; nothing else. But
now that you have had a second experience of it, I
don&rsquo;t doubt that you do see this spectre, and that the
dream follows as a sequence to it. And I think,&rdquo; she
added, slowly and emphatically, &ldquo;that it has come to
warn you of some threatened harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seem to see that it has,&rdquo; murmured Lavinia.
&ldquo;Why else should it come at all? I wish I could
picture it to you half vividly enough: the reality of
it and the horror. Mary, I am growing seriously
afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were I you, I should get away from the house,&rdquo;
said Madame Carimon. &ldquo;Leave them to themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what I mean to do, Mary. I cannot remain
in it, apart from this undefined fear&mdash;which of course
<em>may</em> be only superstitious fancy,&rdquo; hastily acknowledged
Lavinia. &ldquo;If things continue in the present
state&mdash;and there is no prospect of their changing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should leave at once&mdash;as soon as they arrive
home,&rdquo; rather sharply interrupted Mary Carimon,
who seemed to like the aspect of what she had heard
less and less.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as I can make arrangements. They come
home to-night; I received a letter from Nancy this
morning. They have been only at Pontipette all the
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only at Pontipette!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nancy says so. It did as well as any other place.
Captain Fennel&rsquo;s motive was to hide away from the
lawyers we met at the table d&rsquo;hôte.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they left Sainteville, I wonder, those
lawyers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lavinia. &ldquo;On Friday I met Mr.
Lockett when I was going to the Rue Lamartine, and
he told me he was leaving for Calais with his friend
on Saturday morning. It is rather remarkable,&rdquo; she
added, after a pause, &ldquo;that the first time I saw that
appearance in the passage and dreamed the dream,
should have been the eve of Mr. Fennel&rsquo;s return here,
and that it is the same again now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must leave the house, Lavinia,&rdquo; reiterated
Madame Carimon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; considered Lavinia. &ldquo;April comes in
this week. Next week will be Passion Week, preceding
Easter. I will stay with them over Easter,
and then leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Monsieur Jules Carimon&rsquo;s sock, in process of renovation,
had been allowed to fall upon the mender&rsquo;s lap.
She slowly took it up again, speaking thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should leave at once; before Easter. But you
will see how he behaves, Lavinia. If not well; if he
gives you any cause of annoyance, come away there
and then. We will take you in, mind, if you have
not found a place to go to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia thanked her, and rearranged her bonnet
preparatory to returning home. She went out with a
heavy heart. Only one poor twelvemonth to have
brought about all this change!</p>

<p>At the door of the Petite Maison Rouge, when she
reached it, stood Flore, parleying with a slim youth,
who held an open paper in his outstretched hand.
Flore was refusing to touch the paper, which was
both printed and written on, and looked official.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell him that Monsieur le Capitaine is not at
home; he can bring it when he is,&rdquo; explained Flore
to her mistress in English.</p>

<p>Lavinia turned to the young man. &ldquo;Captain
Fennel has been away from Sainteville for a few days;
he probably will be here to-morrow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do
you wish to leave this paper for him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the messenger, evidently understanding
English but speaking in French, as he contrived to
slip the paper into Miss Preen&rsquo;s unconscious hand.
&ldquo;You will have the politeness to give it to him,
madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, with that, he went off down the entry,
whistling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what the paper is, Flore?&rdquo; asked
Lavinia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said Flore. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen these papers
before to-day. It&rsquo;s just a sort of order from the law
court on Captain Fennel, to pay up some debt that he
owes; and, if he does not pay, the court will issue a
procès against him. That&rsquo;s what it is, madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia carried the paper into the salon, and sat
studying it. As far as she could make it out, Mr.
Edwin Fennel was called upon to pay to some creditor
the sum of one hundred and eighty-three francs, without
delay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over seven pounds! And if he does not pay, the
law expenses, to enforce it, will increase the debt
perhaps by one-half,&rdquo; sighed Lavinia. &ldquo;There may
be, and no doubt <em>are</em>, other things at the back of
this. Will he turn us out of house and home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Propping the paper against the wall over the
mantelpiece, she left it there, that it might meet the
captain&rsquo;s eye on his return.</p>

<p>Not until quite late that evening did Madame
Carimon get her husband to herself, for he brought
in one of the young under-masters at the college to
dine with them. But as soon as they were sitting
cosily alone, he smoking his pipe before bed-time, she
told him all she had heard from Lavinia Preen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it, Jules; I don&rsquo;t indeed,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;It has made a strangely disagreeable impression on
me. What is your opinion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Placid Monsieur Jules did not seem to have much
opinion one way or the other. Upon the superstitious
portion of the tale he, being a practical Frenchman,
totally declined to have any at all. He was very
sorry for the uncomfortable position Miss Preen found
herself in, and he certainly was not surprised she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
should wish to quit the Petite Maison Rouge if affairs
could not be made more agreeable there. As to the
Capitaine Fennel, he felt free to confess there was
something about him which he did not like: and he
was sure no man of honour ought to have run away
clandestinely, as he did, with Miss Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Jules, what the man aims at is to get
hold of Nancy&rsquo;s income and apply it to his own uses&mdash;and
for Lavinia to keep them upon hers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Jules.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Lavinia <em>cannot</em> do it; she has not half
enough. It troubles me very much,&rdquo; flashed Madame
Carimon. &ldquo;She says she shall stay with them until
Easter is over. <em>I</em> should not; I should leave them to
it to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, that&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; nodded Monsieur
Jules; &ldquo;but we cannot always do precisely
what we would. Miss Preen is responsible for the
rent of that house, and if Fennel and his wife do not
pay it, she would have to. She must have a thorough
understanding upon that point before she leaves it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the nine-o&rsquo;clock train that night they came
home, Lavinia, pleading a bad headache and feeling
altogether out of sorts, got Flore to remain for once,
and went herself to bed. She dreaded the very sight
of Captain Fennel.</p>

<p>In the morning she saw that the paper had disappeared
from the mantelpiece. He was quite jaunty
at breakfast, talking to her and Nancy about Pontipette;
and things passed pleasantly. About eleven
o&rsquo;clock he began brushing his hat to go out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a look at Griffin, and see how
he&rsquo;s getting on,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Perhaps the old man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
would enjoy a drive this fine day; if so, you may not
see me back till dinner-time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But just as Captain Fennel turned out of the Place
Ronde to the Rue Tessin, he came upon Charles
Palliser, strolling along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine day, Mr. Charles,&rdquo; he remarked graciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Capital,&rdquo; assented Charles, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m glad of it;
the old gentleman will have a good passage. I&rsquo;ve
just seen him off by the eleven train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me you spend your time in seeing people
off by trains. Which old gentleman is it now?&mdash;him
from below?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charley laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Griffin this time,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Being feeble, I thought I might be of use in starting
him, and went up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Griffin!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Fennel. &ldquo;Why,
where&rsquo;s he gone to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Calais. En route for Dover and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he gone for? When&rsquo;s he coming back?&rdquo;
interrupted the captain, speaking like a man in great
amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not coming back at all; he has gone for
good,&rdquo; said Charley. &ldquo;His daughter came to fetch
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why on earth should she do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems that her husband, a clergyman at Kensington,
fell across Major Smith last week in London,
and put some pretty close questions to him about the
old man, for they had been made uneasy by his letters
of late. The major&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What business had the major in London?&rdquo; questioned
Captain Fennel impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can ask him,&rdquo; said Charles equably, &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
didn&rsquo;t. He is back again. Well, Major Smith, being
questioned, made no bones about it at all; said Griffin
and Griffin&rsquo;s money both wanted looking after. Upon
that, the daughter came straight off, arriving here on
Sunday morning; she settled things yesterday, and
has carried her father away to-day. He was as
pleased as Punch, poor childish old fellow, at the
prospect of a voyage in the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether this information put a check upon any
little plan Captain Fennel may have been entertaining,
Charles Palliser could not positively know; but he
thought he had never seen so evil an eye as the one
glaring upon him. Only for a moment; just a flash;
and then the face was smoothed again. Charley had
his ideas&mdash;and all his wits about him; and old Griffin
had babbled publicly.</p>

<p>Captain Fennel strolled by his side towards the
port, talking of Pontipette and other matters of indifference.
When in sight of the harbour, he halted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must wish you good-day now, Palliser; I have
letters to write,&rdquo; said he; and walked briskly back
again.</p>

<p>Lavinia and Nancy were sitting together in the
salon when he reached home. Nancy was looking
scared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edwin,&rdquo; she said, leaving her chair to meet him&mdash;&ldquo;Edwin,
what do you think Lavinia has been saying?
That she is going to leave us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed,&rdquo; he carelessly answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is true, Edwin; she means it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I mean it,&rdquo; interposed Lavinia very quietly.
&ldquo;You and Nancy will be better without me; perhaps
happier.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at her for a full minute in silence, then
laughed a little. &ldquo;Like Darby and Joan,&rdquo; he remarked,
as he put his writing-case on the table and
sat down to it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fennel returned to her chair by Lavinia, who
was sitting close to the window mending a lace collar
which had been torn in the ironing. As usual Nancy
was doing nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> leave me, Lavinia, you know,&rdquo; she
said in coaxing tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that I never thought to do so, Ann, but
circumstances alter cases,&rdquo; answered the elder sister.
Both of them had dropped their voices to a low key,
not to disturb the letter-writer. But he could hear
if he chose to listen. &ldquo;I began putting my things
together yesterday, and shall finish doing it at leisure.
I will stay over Easter with you; but go then I shall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be cruel to think of such a thing,
Lavinia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not cruel,&rdquo; corrected Lavinia. &ldquo;I am sorry, Ann,
but the step is forced upon me. The anxieties in
regard to money matters are wearing me out; they
would wear me out altogether if I did not end them.
And there are other things which urge upon me the
expediency of departure from this house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot speak of them. Never mind what they
are, Ann. They concern myself; not you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ann Fennel sat twirling one of her fair silken
ringlets between her thumb and finger; a habit of
hers when thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where shall you live, Lavinia, if you do leave?
Take another apartment at Sainteville?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not. It is a puzzling question. Possibly
I may go back to Buttermead, and get some family
to take me in as a boarder,&rdquo; dreamily answered
Lavinia. &ldquo;Seventy pounds a-year will not keep me
luxuriously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Fennel lifted his face. &ldquo;If it will not keep
one, how is it to keep two?&rdquo; he demanded, in rather
defiant tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about that,&rdquo; said Lavinia
civilly. &ldquo;I have not two to keep; only one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy chanced to catch a glimpse of his face just
then, and its look frightened her. Lavinia had her
back to him, and did not see it. Nancy began to cry
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lavinia, you will think better of this; you
will not leave us!&rdquo; she implored. &ldquo;We could not do
at all without you and your half of the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia had finished her collar, and rose to take it
upstairs. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be distressed, Nancy,&rdquo; she paused to
say; &ldquo;it is a thing that <em>must be</em>. I am very sorry;
but it is not my fault. As you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can stay in the house if you choose!&rdquo; flashed
Nancy, growing feebly angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I cannot. I <em>cannot</em>,&rdquo; repeated Lavinia. &ldquo;I
begin to foresee that I might&mdash;might die of it.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>Sainteville felt surprised and sorry to hear that Miss
Preen was going to leave it to its own devices, for the
town had grown to like her. Lavinia did not herself
talk about going, but the news somehow got wind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
People wondered why she went. Matters, as connected
with the financial department of the Petite Maison
Rouge, were known but imperfectly&mdash;to most people
not known at all; so that reason was not thought of.
It was quite understood that Ann Preen&rsquo;s stolen
marriage, capped by the bringing home of her husband
to the Petite Maison Rouge, had been a sharp blow to
Miss Preen: perhaps, said Sainteville now, she had
tried living with them and found it did not answer.
Or perhaps she was only going away for a change, and
would return after a while.</p>

<p>Passion week passed, and Easter week came in, and
Lavinia made her arrangements for the succeeding one.
On the Tuesday in that next week, all being well, she
would quit Sainteville. Her preparations were made;
her larger box was already packed and corded. Nancy,
of shallow temperament and elastic spirits, seemed
quite to have recovered from the sting of the proposed
parting; she helped Lavinia to put up her laces and
other little fine things, prattling all the time. Captain
Fennel maintained his suavity. Beyond the words he
had spoken&mdash;as to how she expected the income to
keep two if it would not keep one&mdash;he had said
nothing. It might be that he hardly yet believed
Lavinia would positively go.</p>

<p>But she was going. At first only to Boulogne-sur-Mer.
Monsieur Jules Carimon had a cousin, Madame
Degravier, who kept a superior boarding-house there,
much patronized by the English; he had written to
her to introduce Miss Preen, and to intimate that it
would oblige him if the terms were made très facile.
Madame had written back to Lavinia most satisfactorily,
and, so far, that was arranged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Once at Boulogne in peace and quietness, Lavinia
would have leisure to decide upon her future plans.
She hoped to pay a visit to Buttermead in the
summer-time, for she had begun to yearn for a sight
of the old place and its people. After that&mdash;well, she
should see. If things went on pleasantly at Sainteville&mdash;that
is, if Captain Fennel and Nancy were still
in the Petite Maison Rouge, and he was enabled to
find means to continue in it&mdash;then, perhaps, she might
return to the town. Not to make one of the household&mdash;never
again that; but she might find a little pied-à-terre
in some other home.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lavinia heard no more of the procès,
and she wondered how the captain was meeting it.
During the Easter week she made her farewell calls.
That week she was not very much at home; one or
other of her old acquaintances wanted her. Major
and Mrs. Smith had her to spend a day with them;
the Miss Bosanquets invited her also; and so on.</p>

<p>One call, involving also private business, she made
upon old Madame Sauvage, Mary Carimon accompanying
her. Monsieur Gustave was called up to the salon
to assist at the conference. Lavinia partly explained
her position to them in strict confidence, and the
motive, as touching pecuniary affairs, which was
taking her away: she said nothing of that other and
greater motive, her superstitious fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come to speak of the rent,&rdquo; she said to
Monsieur Gustave, and Mary Carimon repeated the
words in French to old Madame Sauvage. &ldquo;You
must in future look to Captain Fennel for it; you
must make him pay it if possible. At the same time,
I admit my own responsibility,&rdquo; added Lavinia, &ldquo;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
if it be found totally impracticable to get it from
Captain Fennel or my sister, I shall pay it to you.
This must, of course, be kept strictly between ourselves,
Monsieur Gustave; you and madame understand
that. If Captain Fennel gained any intimation
of it, he would take care not to pay it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur Gustave and madame his mother assured
her that they fully understood, and that she might
rely upon their honour. They were grieved to lose
so excellent a tenant and neighbour as Miss Preen,
and wished circumstances had been more kindly.
One thing she might rest assured of&mdash;that they should
feel at least as mortified at having to apply to her for
the rent as she herself would be, and they would not
leave a stone unturned to extract it from the hands of
Captain Fennel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has altogether been a most bitter trial to me,&rdquo;
sighed Lavinia, as she stood up to say farewell to
madame.</p>

<p>The old lady understood, and the tears came into
her compassionate eyes as she held Lavinia&rsquo;s hands
between her own. &ldquo;Ay, for certain,&rdquo; she replied in
French. &ldquo;She and her sons had said so privately to
one another ever since the abrupt coming home of the
strange captain to the petite maison à côté.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Sunday, Lavinia, accompanied by Nancy and
Captain Fennel, attended morning service for the last
time. She spoke to several acquaintances coming out,
wishing them good-bye, and was hastening to overtake
her sister, when she heard rapid steps behind
her, and a voice speaking. Turning, she saw Charley
Palliser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Preen,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;my aunt wants you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
come home and dine with us. See, she is waiting for
you. You could not come any one day last week,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not able to come to you last week, Mr.
Charles; I had so much to do, and so many engagements,&rdquo;
said Lavinia, as she walked back to Mrs.
Hardy, who stood smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will come to-day, dear Miss Preen,&rdquo; said
old Mrs. Hardy, who had caught the words. &ldquo;We
have a lovely fricandeau of veal, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that is just our own dinner,&rdquo; interrupted
Lavinia gaily. &ldquo;I should like to come to you, Mrs.
Hardy, but I cannot. It is my last Sunday at home,
and I could not well go out and leave them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They saw the force of the objection. Mrs. Hardy
asked whether she should be at church in the evening.
Lavinia replied that she intended to be, and they
agreed to bid each other farewell then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve lost, Miss Preen,&rdquo;
said Charley comically. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a huge cream tart&mdash;lovely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Fennel was quite lively at the dinner-table.
He related a rather laughable story which had been
told him by Major Smith, with whom he had walked for
ten minutes after church, and was otherwise gracious.</p>

<p>After dinner, while Flore was taking away the
things, he left the room, and came back with three
glasses of liqueur, on a small waiter, handing one to
Lavinia, another to his wife, and keeping the third
himself. It was the yellow chartreuse; Captain
Fennel kept a bottle of it and of one or two other
choice liqueurs in the little cupboard at the end of the
passage, and treated them to a glass sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How delightful!&rdquo; cried Nancy, who liked chartreuse
and anything else that was good.</p>

<p>They sat and sipped it, talking pleasantly together.
The captain soon finished his, and said he should take
a stroll on the pier. It was a bright day with a brisk
wind, which seemed to be getting higher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The London boat ought to be in about four
o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s catching it sweetly, I
know; passengers will look like ghosts. Au revoir;
don&rsquo;t get quarrelling.&rdquo; And thus, nodding to the two
ladies, he went out gaily.</p>

<p>Not much danger of their quarrelling. They turned
their chairs to the fire, and plunged into conversation,
which chanced to turn upon Buttermead. In calling
up one reminiscence of the old place after another,
now Lavinia, now Nancy, the time passed on. Lavinia
wore her silver-grey silk dress that day, with some
yellowish-looking lace falling at the throat and wrists.</p>

<p>Flore came in to bring the tea-tray; she always
put it on the table in readiness on a Sunday afternoon.
The water, she said, would be on the boil in
the kitchen by the time they wanted it. And then
she went away as usual for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, Lavinia, who was speaking,
suddenly stopped in the middle of a sentence. She
started up in her chair, fell back again, and clasped
her hands below her chest with a great cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nancy!&mdash;Nancy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy dashed across the hearthrug. &ldquo;What is
it?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What is it, Lavinia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia apparently could not say what it was.
She seemed to be in the greatest agony; her face had
turned livid. Nancy was next door to an imbecile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
in any emergency, and fairly wrung her hands in her
distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what can be the matter with me?&rdquo; gasped
Lavinia. &ldquo;Nancy, I think I am dying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next moment she had glided from the chair
to the floor, and lay there shrieking and writhing.
Bursting away, Nancy ran round to the next house,
all closed to-day, rang wildly at the private door, and
when it was opened by Mariette, rushed upstairs to
madame&rsquo;s salon.</p>

<p>Madame Veuve Sauvage, comprehending that something
was amiss, without understanding Nancy&rsquo;s frantic
words, put a shawl on her shoulders to hasten to the
other house, ordering Mariette to follow her. Her
sons were out.</p>

<p>There lay Lavinia, in the greatest agony. Madame
Sauvage sent Mariette off for Monsieur Dupuis, and
told her to fly. &ldquo;Better bring Monsieur Henri Dupuis,
Mariette,&rdquo; she called after her: &ldquo;he will get quicker
over the ground than his old father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Monsieur Henri Dupuis, as it turned out, was
absent. He had left that morning for Calais with his
wife, to spend two days with her friends who lived
there, purposing to be back early on Tuesday morning.
Old Monsieur Dupuis came very quickly. He
thought Mademoiselle Preen must have inward inflammation,
he said to Madame Sauvage, and inquired
what she had eaten for dinner. Nancy told him as
well as she could between her sobs and her broken
speech.</p>

<p>A fricandeau of veal, potatoes, a cauliflower au
gratin, and a frangipane tart from the pastrycook&rsquo;s.
No fruit or any other dessert. They took a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Bordeaux wine with dinner, and a liqueur glass of
chartreuse afterwards.</p>

<p>All very wholesome, pronounced Monsieur Dupuis,
with satisfaction; not at all likely to disagree with
mademoiselle. Possibly she had caught a chill.</p>

<p>Mariette had run for Flore, who came in great
consternation. Between them all they got Lavinia
upstairs, undressed her and laid her in bed, applying
hot flannels to the pain&mdash;and Monsieur Dupuis administered
in a wine-glass of water every quarter-of-an-hour
some drops from a glass phial which he had
brought in his pocket.</p>

<p>It was close upon half-past five when Captain
Fennel came in. He expressed much surprise and
concern, saying, like the doctor, that she must have
eaten something which had disagreed with her. The
doctor avowed that he could not otherwise account for
the seizure; he did not altogether think it was produced
by a chill; and he spoke again of the dinner.
Captain Fennel observed that as to the dinner they
had all three partaken of it, one the same as another;
he did not see why it should affect his sister-in-law
and not himself or his wife. This reasoning was
evident, admitted Monsieur Dupuis; but Miss Preen
had touched nothing since her breakfast, except at
dinner. In point of fact, he felt very much at a loss,
he did not scruple to add; but the more acute
symptoms were showing a slight improvement, he
was thankful to perceive, and he trusted to bring her
round.</p>

<p>As he did. In a few hours the pain had so far
abated, or yielded to remedies, that poor Lavinia,
worn out, dropped into a comfortable sleep. Monsieur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Dupuis was round again early in the morning, and
found her recovered, though still feeling tired and
very weak. He advised her to lie in bed until the
afternoon; not to get up then unless she felt inclined;
and he charged her to take chiefly milk food all the
day&mdash;no solids whatever.</p>

<p>Lavinia slept again all the morning, and awoke
very much refreshed. In the afternoon she felt quite
equal to getting up, and did so, dressing herself in the
grey silk she had worn the previous day, because it
was nearest at hand. She then penned a line to
Madame Degravier, saying she was unable to travel
to Boulogne on the morrow, as had been fixed, but
hoped to be there on Wednesday, or, at the latest,
Thursday.</p>

<p>Captain Fennel, who generally took possession of
the easiest chair in the salon, and the warmest place,
resigned it to Lavinia the instant she appeared downstairs.
He shook her by the hand, said how glad he
was that she had recovered from her indisposition,
and installed her in the chair with a cushion at her
back and a rug over her knees. All she had to dread
now, he thought, was cold; she must guard against
that. Lavinia replied that she could not in the least
imagine what had been the matter with her; she had
never had a similar attack before, and had never been
in such dreadful pain.</p>

<p>Presently Mary Carimon came in, having heard of
the affair from Mariette, whom she had met in the
fish-market during the morning. All danger was
over, Mariette said, and mademoiselle was then sleeping
quietly: so Madame Carimon, not to disturb her,
put off calling until the afternoon. Captain Fennel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
sat talking with her a few minutes, and then went
out. For some cause or other he never seemed to be
quite at ease in the presence of Madame Carimon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what it must have been,&rdquo; cried Mary
Carimon, coming to one of her rapid conclusions after
listening to the description of the illness. &ldquo;Misled by
the sunny spring days last week, you went and left
off some of your warm underclothing, Lavinia, and so
caught cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed Nancy, who had curled
herself up on the sofa like a ball, not having yet
recovered from her fatigue and fright. &ldquo;Leave off
one&rsquo;s warm things the beginning of April! I never
heard of such imprudence! How came you to do it,
Lavinia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not do it,&rdquo; said Lavinia quietly. &ldquo;I have
not left off anything. Should I be so silly as to do
that with a journey before me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what caused the attack?&rdquo; debated Madame
Carimon. &ldquo;Something you had eaten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia shook her head helplessly. &ldquo;It could
hardly have been that, Mary. I took nothing whatever
that Nancy and Captain Fennel did not take. I
wish I did know&mdash;that I might guard, if possible,
against a similar attack in future. The pain seized
me all in a moment. I thought I was dying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds odd,&rdquo; said Madame Carimon. &ldquo;Monsieur
Dupuis does not know either, it seems. That&rsquo;s why I
thought you might have been leaving off your things,
and did not like to tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I conclude that it must have been one of those
mysterious attacks of sudden illness to which we are
all liable, but for which no one can account,&rdquo; sighed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Lavinia. &ldquo;I hope I shall never have it again. This
experience has been enough for a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Carimon warmly echoed the hope as she rose
to take her departure. She advised Lavinia to go to
bed early, and promised to come again in the morning.</p>

<p>While Captain Fennel and Nancy dined, Flore made
her mistress some tea, and brought in with it some
thin bread-and-butter. Lavinia felt all the better for
the refreshment, laughingly remarking that by the
morning she was sure she should be as hungry as a
hunter. She sat chatting, and sometimes dozing
between whiles, until about a quarter to nine o&rsquo;clock,
when she said she would go to bed.</p>

<p>Nancy went to the kitchen to make her a cup of
arrowroot. Lavinia then wished Captain Fennel
good-night, and went upstairs. Flore had left as
usual, after washing up the dinner-things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lavinia, shall I&mdash;&mdash; Oh, she has gone on,&rdquo; broke
off Nancy, who had come in with the breakfast-cup of
arrowroot in her hand. &ldquo;Edwin, do you think I may
venture to put a little brandy into this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Fennel sat reading with his face to the
fire and the lamp at his elbow. He turned round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brandy?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. If
that pain meant inflammation, brandy might do harm.
Ask Lavinia; she had better decide for herself. No,
no; leave the arrowroot on the table here,&rdquo; he hastily
cried, as Nancy was going out of the room with the
cup. &ldquo;Tell Lavinia to come down, and we&rsquo;ll discuss
the matter with her. Of course a little brandy would
do her an immense deal of good, if she might take it
with safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy did as she was told. Leaving the cup and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
saucer on the table, she went up to her sister. In a
minute or two she was back again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lavinia won&rsquo;t come down again, Edwin; she is
already half-undressed. She thinks she had better be
on the safe side, and not have the brandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied the captain, who was sitting as
before, intent on his book. Nancy took the cup upstairs.</p>

<p>She helped her sister into bed, and then gave her
the arrowroot, inquiring whether she had made it
well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite well, only it was rather sweet,&rdquo; answered
Lavinia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweet!&rdquo; echoed Nancy, in reply. &ldquo;Why, I hardly
put any sugar at all into it; I remembered that you
don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia finished the cupful. Nancy tucked her up,
and gave her a good-night kiss. &ldquo;Pleasant dreams,
Lavinia dear,&rdquo; she called back, as she was shutting the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Nancy; but I hope I shall sleep
to-night without dreaming,&rdquo; answered Lavinia.</p>

<p>As Nancy went downstairs she turned into the
kitchen for her own arrowroot, which she had left all
that time in the saucepan. Being fond of it, she had
made enough for herself as well as for Lavinia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>


<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>It was between half-past ten and eleven, and Captain
and Mrs. Fennel were in their bedroom preparing to
retire to rest. She stood before the glass doing her
hair, having thrown a thin print cotton cape upon her
shoulders as usual, to protect her dress; he had taken
off his coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; cried she, in startled tones.</p>

<p>Some sound had penetrated to their room. The
captain put his coat on a chair and bent his ear. &ldquo;I
did not hear anything, Nancy,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it is again!&rdquo; exclaimed Nancy. &ldquo;Oh, it is
Lavinia! I do believe it is Lavinia!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flinging the comb from her hand, Nancy dashed
out at the room-door, which was near the head of the
stairs; Lavinia&rsquo;s door being nearly at the end of the
passage. Unmistakable sounds, now a shriek, now a
wail, came from Lavinia&rsquo;s chamber. Nancy flew into
it, her fair hair falling on her shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Lavinia? Oh, Edwin, Edwin, come
here!&rdquo; called Mrs. Fennel, beside herself with terror.
Lavinia was rolling about the bed, as she had the
previous day rolled on the salon floor; her face was
distorted with pain, her moans and cries were
agonizing.</p>

<p>Captain Fennel stayed to put on his coat, came to
Lavinia&rsquo;s door, and put his head inside it. &ldquo;Is it the
pain again?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is the pain again,&rdquo; gasped Lavinia, in
answer. &ldquo;I am dying, I am surely dying!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That put the finishing-touch to timorous Nancy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
&ldquo;Edwin, run, run for Monsieur Dupuis!&rdquo; she implored.
&ldquo;Oh, what shall we do? What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Fennel descended the stairs. When Nancy
thought he must have been gone out at least a minute
or two, he appeared again with a wine-glass of hot
brandy-and-water, which he had stayed to mix.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try and get her to take this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t
do harm; it may do good. And if you could put hot
flannels to her, Nancy, it might be well; they eased
the pain yesterday. I&rsquo;ll bring Dupuis here as soon as
I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia could not take the brandy-and-water, and
it was left upon the grey marble top of the chest of
drawers. Her paroxysms increased; Nancy had never
seen or imagined such pain, for this attack was worse
than the other, and she almost lost her wits with
terror. Could she see Lavinia die before her eyes?&mdash;no
helping hand near to strive to save her? Just as
Nancy had done before, she did again now.</p>

<p>Flying down the stairs and out of the house, across
the yard and through the dark entry, she seized the
bell-handle of Madame Veuve Sauvage&rsquo;s door and
pulled it frantically. The household had all retired
for the night.</p>

<p>Presently a window above opened, and Monsieur
Gustave&mdash;Nancy knew his voice&mdash;looked out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he asked in French. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Monsieur Gustave, come in for the love of
Heaven!&rdquo; responded poor Nancy, looking up. &ldquo;She
has another attack, worse than the first; she&rsquo;s dying,
and there&rsquo;s no one in the house but me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Directly, madame; I am with you on the instant,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
he kindly answered. &ldquo;I but wait to put on my
effects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was at the Petite Maison Rouge almost as soon
as she; his brother Emile followed him in, and
Mariette, whom they had called, came shortly. Miss
Preen lay in dreadful paroxysms; it did appear to
them that she must die. Nancy and Mariette busied
themselves in the kitchen, heating flannels.</p>

<p>The doctor did not seem to come very quickly.
Captain Fennel at length made his appearance and
said Monsieur Dupuis would be there in a minute or
two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am content to hear that,&rdquo; remarked Monsieur
Gustave in reply. &ldquo;I was just about to despatch my
brother for the first doctor he could find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never had such trouble in ringing up a doctor
before,&rdquo; returned Captain Fennel. &ldquo;I suppose the old
man sleeps too soundly to be easily aroused; many
elderly people do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear she is dying,&rdquo; whispered Monsieur Gustave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, surely not!&rdquo; cried Captain Fennel, recoiling
a step at the words. &ldquo;What can it possibly be?
What causes the attacks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whilst Monsieur Gustave was shaking his head at
this difficult question, Monsieur Dupuis arrived.
Monsieur Emile, anxious to make himself useful, was
requested by Mariette to go to Flore&rsquo;s domicile and
ring her up. Flore seemed to have been sleeping with
her clothes on, for they came back together.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupuis could do nothing for his patient.
He strove to administer drops of medicinal remedies;
he caused her to be nearly smothered in scalding-hot
flannels&mdash;all in vain. He despatched Monsieur Emile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Sauvage to bring in another doctor, Monsieur Podevin,
who lived near. All in vain. Lavinia died. Just at
one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, before the cocks had begun
to crow, Lavinia Preen died.</p>

<p>The shock to those in the house was great. It
seemed to stun them, one and all. The brothers
Sauvage, leaving a few words of heartfelt sympathy
with Captain Fennel, withdrew silently to their own
home. Mariette stayed. The two doctors, shut up
in the salon, talked with one another, endeavouring to
account for the death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inflammation, no doubt,&rdquo; observed Monsieur
Dupuis; &ldquo;but even so, the death has been too
speedy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More like poison,&rdquo; rejoined the younger man,
Monsieur Podevin. He was brother to the proprietor
of the Hôtel des Princes, and was much respected by
his fellow-citizens as a safe and skilful practitioner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thought of poison naturally occurred to me
on Sunday, when I was first called to her,&rdquo; returned
Monsieur Dupuis, &ldquo;but it could not be borne out.
You see, she had partaken of nothing, either in food
or drink, but what the other inmates had taken;
absolutely nothing. This was assured me by them
all, herself included.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She seems to have taken nothing to-day, either,
that could in any way harm her,&rdquo; said Monsieur
Podevin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing. She took a cup of tea at five o&rsquo;clock,
which the servant, Flore, prepared and also partook of
herself&mdash;a cup out of the same teapot. Later, when
the poor lady went to bed, her sister made her a basin
of arrowroot, and made herself one at the same time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it appears strange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It could not have been a chill. The symptoms&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A chill?&mdash;bah!&rdquo; interrupted Monsieur Podevin.
&ldquo;We shall know more after the post-mortem,&rdquo; he
added, taking up his hat. &ldquo;Of course there must be
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wishing his brother practitioner good-night, he left.
Monsieur Dupuis went looking about for Captain
Fennel, and found him in the kitchen, standing by
the hot stove, and drinking a glass of hot brandy-and-water.
The rest were upstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This event has shaken my nerves, doctor,&rdquo;
apologized the captain, in reference to the glass. &ldquo;I
never was so upset. Shall I mix you one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupuis shook his head. He never took
anything so strong. The most calming thing, in his
opinion, was a glass of eau sucrée, with a teaspoonful
of orange-flower water in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I have been conversing with
my esteemed confrère. We cannot, either of us, decide
what mademoiselle has died of, being unable to see
any adequate cause for it; and we wish to hold a
post-mortem examination. I presume you will not
object to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not; I think there should be one,&rdquo;
briskly spoke Captain Fennel after a moment&rsquo;s pause.
&ldquo;For our satisfaction, if for nothing else, doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. Will nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning suit
you, as to time? It should be made early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;expect it will,&rdquo; answered the captain, reflecting.
&ldquo;Do you hold it here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly. In her own room.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then wait just one minute, will you, doctor, whilst
I speak to my wife. Nine o&rsquo;clock seems a little early,
but I dare say it will suit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupuis went back into the salon. He
had waited there a short interval, when Mrs. Fennel
burst in, wild with excitement. Her hair still hung
down her back, her eyes were swollen with weeping,
her face was one of piteous distress. She advanced to
Monsieur Dupuis, and held up her trembling hands.</p>

<p>The old doctor understood English fairly well when
it was quietly spoken; but he did not in the least
understand it in a storm. Sobbing, trembling, Mrs.
Fennel was beseeching him not to hold a post-mortem
on her poor dead sister, for the love of mercy.</p>

<p>Surprised and distressed, he placed her on the sofa,
soothed her into calmness, and then bade her tell him
quietly what her petition was. She repeated it&mdash;begging,
praying, imploring him not to disturb her
sister now she was at rest; but to let her be put into
her grave in peace. Well, well, said the compassionate
old man; if it would pain the relatives so greatly to
have it done, he and Monsieur Podevin would, of
course, abandon the idea. It would be a satisfaction
to them both to be able to decide upon the cause of
death, but they did not wish to proceed in it against
the feelings of the family.</p>

<p>Sainteville woke up in the morning to a shock.
Half the townspeople still believed that Miss Preen
was leaving that day, Tuesday, for Boulogne; and to
hear that she would not go on that journey, that she
would never go on any earthly journey again, that
she was <em>dead</em>, shook them to the centre.</p>

<p>What had been the matter with her?&mdash;what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
killed her so quickly in the midst of life and health?
Groups asked this; one group meeting another.
&ldquo;Inflammation,&rdquo; was the answer&mdash;for that report had
somehow started itself. She caught a chill on the
Sunday, probably when leaving the church after
morning service; it induced speedy and instant
inflammation, and she had died of it.</p>

<p>With softened steps and mournful faces, hosts of
people made their way to the Place Ronde. Only to
take a glimpse at the outside of the Maison Rouge
brought satisfaction to excited feelings. Monsieur
Gustave Sauvage had caused his white shop window-blinds
to be drawn half-way down, out of respect to
the dead; all the windows above had the green
persiennes closed before them. The calamity had so
greatly affected old Madame Sauvage that she lay
in bed.</p>

<p>When her sons returned indoors after the death
had taken place, their mother called them to her
room. Nancy&rsquo;s violent ringing had disturbed her,
and she had lain since then in anxiety, waiting for
news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not tell the mother to-night,&rdquo; whispered
Emile to his brother outside her door.</p>

<p>But the mother&rsquo;s ears were quick; she was sitting
up in bed, and the door was ajar. &ldquo;Yes, you will tell
me, my sons,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am fearing the worst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mother, it is all over,&rdquo; avowed Gustave.
&ldquo;The attack was more violent than the one last night,
and the poor lady is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May the good God have taken her to His rest!&rdquo;
fervently aspirated madame. But she lay down in
the bed in her distress and covered her face with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
white-frilled pillow and sobbed a little. Gustave and
Emile related a few particulars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what was really the malady? What is it
that she has died of?&rdquo; questioned the mother, wiping
her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not settled; nobody seems to know,&rdquo;
replied Gustave.</p>

<p>Madame Veuve Sauvage lay still, thinking. &ldquo;I&mdash;hope&mdash;that&mdash;man&mdash;has&mdash;not&mdash;done&mdash;her&mdash;any&mdash;injury!&rdquo;
she slowly said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not either; there is no appearance of it,&rdquo;
said Monsieur Gustave. &ldquo;Any way, mother, she had
two skilful doctors with her, honest men and upright.
Better not admit such thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; murmured madame, appeased. &ldquo;I
fear the poor dear lady must have taken a chill,
which struck inwardly. That handsome demoiselle,
the cousin of Monsieur le Procureur, died of the same
thing, you may remember. Good-night, my sons;
you leave me very unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Monsieur Jules
Carimon heard of it. In going through the large
iron entrance-gates of the college to his day&rsquo;s work,
he found himself accosted by one of two or three
young gamins of pupils, who were also entering. It
was Dion Pamart. The well-informed reader is of
course aware that the French educational colleges are
attended by all classes, high and low, indiscriminately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur, have you heard?&rdquo; said the lad, with
timid deprecation. &ldquo;Mademoiselle is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur Jules Carimon turned his eyes on the
speaker. At first he did not recognize him: his own
work lay with the advanced desks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, c&rsquo;est Pamart, n&rsquo;est-ce-pas?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What
did you say, my boy? Some one is dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dion Pamart repeated his information. The master,
inwardly shocked, took refuge in disbelief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you must be mistaken, Pamart,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I&rsquo;m not, sir. Mademoiselle was taken
frightfully ill again last night, and they fetched my
mother. They had two doctors to her and all; but
they couldn&rsquo;t do anything for her, and she died.
Grandmother gave me my breakfast just now; she
said my mother was crying too much to come home.
The other lady, the captain&rsquo;s wife, has been in hysterics
all night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on to your desks,&rdquo; commanded Monsieur
Carimon to the small fry now gathered round him.</p>

<p>He turned back home himself. When he entered
the salle-à-manger, Pauline was carrying away the last
of the breakfast-things. Her mistress stood putting a
little water on a musk plant in the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it you, Jules?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Have you
forgotten something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur Jules shut the door. &ldquo;I have not forgotten
anything,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But I have heard of
a sad calamity, and I have come back to prepare you,
Marie, before you hear it from others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke solemnly; he was looking solemn. His
wife put down the jug of water on the table. &ldquo;A
calamity?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You will grieve to hear it. Your friend,
Miss Preen, was&mdash;was taken ill last night with the
same sort of attack, but more violent; and she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jules, don&rsquo;t tell me, don&rsquo;t tell me!&rdquo; cried Mary
Carimon, lifting her hands to ward off the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
with a too sure prevision of what they were going
to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, you must be told sooner or later,&rdquo;
remonstrated he; &ldquo;you cannot go through even this
morning without hearing it from one person or
another. Flore&rsquo;s boy was my informant. In spite of
all that could be done by those about her, poor lady&mdash;in
spite of the two doctors who were called to her aid&mdash;she
died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Carimon was a great deal too much stunned
for tears. She sank back in a chair with a face of
stone, feeling that the room was turning upside down
about her.</p>

<p>An hour later, when she had somewhat gathered
her scattered senses together, she set off for the Petite
Maison Rouge. Her way lay past the house of
Monsieur Podevin; old Monsieur Dupuis was turning
out of it as she went by. Madame Carimon
stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the doctor said, when a few words had
passed, &ldquo;it is a most desolating affair. But, as madame
knows, when Death has laid his grasp upon a patient,
medical craft loses its power to resist him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too true,&rdquo; murmured Mary Carimon. &ldquo;And what
is it that she has died of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupuis shook his head to indicate that he
did not know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could have wished for an examination, to ascertain
the true cause of the seizure,&rdquo; continued the
doctor, &ldquo;and I come now from expressing my regrets
to my confrère, Monsieur Podevin. He agrees with
me in deciding that we cannot press it in opposition
to the family. Captain Fennel was quite willing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
should take place, but his wife, poor distressed woman,
altogether objects to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Carimon went on to the house of death. She
saw Lavinia, looking so peaceful in her stillness. A
happy smile sat on her countenance. On her white
attire lay some sweet fresh primroses, which Flore had
placed there. Lavinia loved primroses. She used to
say that when she looked at them they brought to
her mind the woods and dales of Buttermead, always
carpeted with the pale, fair blossoms in the spring of
the year. Mrs. Fennel lay in a heavy sleep, exhausted
by her night of distress, Flore informed Madame
Carimon; and the captain, anxious about her, was
sitting in her room, to guard against her being
disturbed.</p>

<p>On the next day, Wednesday, in obedience to the
laws of France relating to the dead, Lavinia Preen was
buried. All the English gentlemen in the town, and
some Frenchmen, including Monsieur Carimon and the
sons of Madame Veuve Sauvage, assembled in the
Place Ronde, and fell in behind the coffin when it was
brought forth. They walked after it to the portion of
the cemetery consecrated to Protestants, and there
witnessed the interment. The tears trickled down
Charley Palliser&rsquo;s face as he took his last look into the
grave, and he was honest enough not to mind who
saw them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>


<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p>In their new mourning, at the English Church, the
Sunday after the interment of Lavinia Preen, appeared
Captain and Mrs. Fennel. The congregation looked at
them more than at the parson. Poor Nancy&rsquo;s eyes
were so blinded with tears that she could not see the
letters in her Prayer-book. Only one little week
ago when she had sat there, Lavinia was on the
bench at her side, alive and well; and now&mdash;&mdash; It
was with difficulty Nancy kept herself from breaking
down.</p>

<p>Two or three acquaintances caught her hand on
leaving the church, whispering a few words of sympathy
in her ear. Not one but felt truly sorry for her.
The captain&rsquo;s hat, which had a wide band round it,
was perpetually raised in acknowledgment of silent
greetings, as he piloted his wife back to their house,
the Petite Maison Rouge.</p>

<p>A very different dinner-table, this which the two
sat down to, from last Sunday&rsquo;s, in the matter of
cheerfulness. Nancy was about half-way through the
wing of the fowl her husband had helped her to, when
a choking sob caught her throat. She dropped her
knife and fork.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Edwin, I cannot! I cannot eat for my unhappy
thoughts! This time last Sunday Lavinia was
seated at the table with us. Now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Nancy&rsquo;s
speech collapsed altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Captain Fennel. &ldquo;I hope you
are not going to be hysterical again, Nancy. It is
frightfully sad; I know that; but this prolonged grief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
will do no good. Go on with your dinner; it is a
very nice chicken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy gave a great sob, and spoke impulsively, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe you regret her one bit, Edwin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edwin Fennel in turn laid down his knife and fork
and stared at his wife. A curious expression sat on
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not regret her,&rdquo; he repeated with emphasis.
&ldquo;Why, Nancy, I regret her every hour of the day.
But I do not make a parade of my regrets. Why
should I?&mdash;to what end? Come, come, my dear; you
will be all the better for eating your dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went on with his own as he spoke. Nancy took
up her knife and fork with a hopeless sigh.</p>

<p>Dinner over, Captain Fennel went to his cupboard
and brought in some of the chartreuse. Two glasses,
this time, instead of three. He might regret Lavinia,
as he said, every hour of the day; possibly he did so;
but it did not seem to affect his appetite, or his relish
for good things.</p>

<p>Most events have their dark and their light sides. It
could hardly escape the mind of Edwin Fennel that by
the death of Lavinia the whole income became Nancy&rsquo;s.
To him that must have been a satisfactory consolation.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he went with Nancy for a walk on
the pier. She did not want to go; said she had no
spirits for it; it was miserable at home; miserable
out; miserable everywhere. Captain Fennel took her
off, as he might have taken a child, telling her she
should come and see the fishing-boats. After tea they
went to church&mdash;an unusual thing for Captain Fennel.
Lavinia and Nancy formerly went to evening service;
he, never.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>That night something curious occurred. Nancy
went up to bed leaving the captain to follow, after
finishing his glass of grog. He generally took one
the last thing. Nancy had taken off her gown, and
was standing before the glass about to undo her hair,
when she heard him leave the parlour. Her bedroom-door,
almost close to the head of the stairs, was not
closed, and her ears were on the alert. Since Lavinia
died, Nancy had felt timid in the house when alone,
and she was listening for her husband to come up.
She heard him lock up the spirit bottle in the little
cupboard below, and begin to ascend the stairs, and
she opened her door wider, that the light might guide
him, for the staircase was in darkness.</p>

<p>Captain Fennel had nearly gained the top, when
something&mdash;he never knew what&mdash;induced him to
look round sharply, as though he fancied some one
was close behind him. In fact, he did fancy it. In a
moment, he gave a shout, dashed onwards into the
bedroom, shut the door with a bang, and bolted it.
Nancy, in great astonishment, turned to look at him.
He seemed to have shrunk within himself in a fit of
trembling, his face was ghastly, and the perspiration
stood upon his brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edwin!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a scared whisper, &ldquo;what
is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Fennel did not answer at first. He was
getting up his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Flore not gone?&rdquo; he then said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Flore!</em>&rdquo; exclaimed Nancy in surprise. &ldquo;Why,
Edwin, you know Flore goes away on Sundays in the
middle of the afternoon! She left before we went on
the pier. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I thought&mdash;some person&mdash;followed me upstairs,&rdquo;
he replied, in uneasy pauses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my goodness!&rdquo; cried timid Nancy. &ldquo;Perhaps
a thief has got into the house!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went to the door, and was about to draw it an
inch open, intending to peep out gingerly and listen,
when her husband pulled her back with a motion of
terror, and put his back against it. This meant, she
thought, that he <em>knew</em> a thief was there. Perhaps
two of them!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there more than one?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Lavinia&rsquo;s
silver&mdash;my silver, now&mdash;is in the basket on
the console in the salon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not answer. He appeared to be listening.
Nancy listened also. The house seemed still as death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I was mistaken,&rdquo; said Captain Fennel,
beginning to recover himself after a bit. &ldquo;I dare say
I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think you must have been, Edwin; I
can&rsquo;t hear anything. We had better open the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She undid the bolt as she spoke, and he moved
away from it. Nancy cautiously took a step outside,
and kept still. Not a sound met her ear. Then she
brought forth the candle and looked down the staircase.
Not a sign of anything or any one met her
eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edwin, there&rsquo;s nothing, there&rsquo;s nobody; come and
see. You must have fancied it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; answered Captain Fennel. But he did
not go to see, for all that.</p>

<p>Nancy went back to the room. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you just
look downstairs?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t much mind
going with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not any necessity,&rdquo; replied he, and began to undress&mdash;and
slipped the bolt again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you bolt the door to-night?&rdquo; asked
Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To keep the thief out,&rdquo; said he, in grim tones,
which Nancy took for jesting. But she could not at
all understand him.</p>

<p>His restlessness kept her awake. &ldquo;It <em>must</em> have
been all fancy,&rdquo; she more than once heard him mutter
to himself.</p>

<p>When he rose in the morning, his restlessness seemed
still to hang upon him. Remarking to Nancy, who
was only half-awake, that his nerves were out of
order, and he should be all the better for a sea-bath,
he dressed and left the room. Nancy got down at
the usual hour, half-past eight; and was told by Flore
that monsieur had left word madame was not to wait
breakfast for him: he was gone to have a dip in the
sea, and should probably take a long country walk
after it.</p>

<p>Flore was making the coffee at the kitchen stove;
her mistress stood by, as if wanting to watch the
process. These last few days, since Lavinia had been
carried from the house, Nancy had felt easier in Flore&rsquo;s
company than when alone with her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to steady his nerves; they are out of order,&rdquo;
replied Nancy, who had as much idea of reticence as
a child. &ldquo;Monsieur had a great fright last night,
Flore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly!&rdquo; said Flore, much occupied just then with
her coffee-pot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was coming up to bed between ten and eleven;
I had gone on. When nearly at the top of the stairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
he thought he heard some one behind him. It startled
him frightfully. Not being prepared for it, supposing
that the house was empty, you see, Flore, of course it
would startle him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally, madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He cried out, and dashed into the bedroom and
bolted the door. I never saw any one in such a state
of terror, Flore; he was trembling all over; his face
was whiter than your apron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vraiment!&rdquo; returned Flore, turning to look at
her mistress in a little surprise. &ldquo;But, madame,
what had terrified him? What was it that he had
seen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he could have seen nothing,&rdquo; corrected Mrs.
Fennel. &ldquo;There was nothing to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame has reason; there could have been
nothing, the house being empty. But then, what
could have frightened him?&rdquo; repeated Flore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he must have fancied it, I suppose. Any
way, he fancied some one was there. The first
question he asked me was, whether you were in the
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moi! Monsieur might have known I should not
be in the house at that hour, madame. And why
should he show terror if he thought it was me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Fennel shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;It was a
moment&rsquo;s scare; just that, I conclude; and it upset
his nerves. A sea-bath will put him all right
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flore carried the coffee into the salon, and her
mistress sat down to breakfast.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that this same week a guest came
to stay with Madame Carimon. Stella Featherston,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
from Buttermead, was about to make a sojourn in
Paris, and she took Sainteville on her route that she
might stay a few days with her cousin, Mary Carimon,
whom she had not seen for several years.</p>

<p>Lavinia and Ann Preen had once been very intimate
with Miss Featherston, who reached Madame Carimon&rsquo;s
on the Thursday. On the Friday morning Mrs.
Fennel called to see her&mdash;and, in Nancy&rsquo;s impromptu
way, she invited her and Mary Carimon to take tea
at seven o&rsquo;clock that same evening at the Petite
Maison Rouge.</p>

<p>Nancy went home delighted. It was a little
divertissement to her present saddened life. Captain
Fennel knitted his brow when he heard of the
arrangement, but made no objection in words. His
wife shrank at the frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like my having invited Miss Featherston
to tea, Edwin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ve no objection to it,&rdquo; he carelessly replied.
&ldquo;I am not in love with either Carimon or his wife,
and don&rsquo;t care how little I see of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He cannot come, having a private class on to-night.
And I could not invite Miss Featherston
without Mary Carimon,&rdquo; pleaded Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so. I am not objecting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this somewhat ungracious assent, Nancy had
to content herself. She ordered a gâteau Suisse, the
nicest sort of gâteau to be had at Sainteville; and
told Flore that she must for once remain for the
evening.</p>

<p>The guests appeared punctually at seven o&rsquo;clock.
Such a thing as being invited for one hour, and
strolling in an hour or two after it, was a mark of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
English breeding never yet heard of in the simple-mannered
French town. Miss Featherston, a smart,
lively young woman, wore a cherry-coloured silk;
Mary Carimon was in black; she had gone into slight
mourning for Lavinia. Good little Monsieur Jules
had put a small band on his hat.</p>

<p>Captain Fennel was not at home to tea, and the
ladies had it all their own way in the matter of talking.
What with items of news from the old home,
Buttermead, and Stella&rsquo;s telling about her own plans,
the conversation never flagged a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I am going to Paris for,&rdquo; said
Stella, explaining her plans. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem likely to
marry, for nobody comes to ask me, and I mean to go
out in the world and make a little money. It is a
sin and a shame that a healthy girl, the eldest of
three sisters, should be living upon her poor mother
in idleness. Not much of a girl, you may say, for I
was three-and-thirty last week! but we all like to
pay ourselves compliments when age is in question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy laughed. Almost the first time she had
laughed since Lavinia&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are going to Paris to learn French, Stella!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to Paris to learn French, Nancy,&rdquo;
assented Miss Featherston. &ldquo;I know it pretty well,
but when I come to speak it I am all at sea; and you
can&rsquo;t get out as a governess now unless you speak it
fluently. At each of the two situations I applied for
in Worcestershire, it was the one fatal objection: &lsquo;We
should have liked you, Miss Featherston, but we can
only engage a lady who will speak French with the
children.&rsquo; So I made my mind up to <em>speak</em> French;
and I wrote to good Monsieur Jules Carimon, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
has found me a place to go to in Paris, where not a
soul in the household speaks English. He says, and I
say, that in six months I shall chatter away like a
native,&rdquo; she concluded, laughing.</p>


<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p>About nine o&rsquo;clock Captain Fennel came home. He
was gracious to the visitors. Stella Featherston
thought his manners were pleasing. Shortly afterwards
Charley Palliser called. He apologized for the
lateness of the hour, but his errand was a good-natured
one. His aunt, Mrs. Hardy, had received a
box of delicious candied fruits from Marseilles; she
had sent him with a few to Mrs. Fennel, if that lady
would kindly accept them. The truth was, every one
in Sainteville felt sorry just now for poor Nancy
Fennel.</p>

<p>Nancy looked as delighted as a child. She called
to Flore to bring plates, turned out the fruits and
handed them round. Flore also brought in the gâteau
Suisse and glasses, and a bottle of Picardin wine, that
the company might regale themselves. Charley
Palliser suddenly spoke; he had just thought of
something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would it be too much trouble to give me back
that book which I lent you a week or two ago&mdash;about
the plans of the fortifications?&rdquo; he asked, turning to
Captain Fennel. &ldquo;I want it sometimes for reference
in my studies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all; I ought to have returned it to you
before this&mdash;but the trouble here has driven other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
things out of my head,&rdquo; replied Captain Fennel. &ldquo;Let
me see&mdash;where did I put it? Nancy, do you remember
where that book is?&mdash;the heavy one, you know, with
red edges and a mottled cover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That book? Why, it is on the drawers in our
bedroom,&rdquo; replied Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure; I&rsquo;ll get it,&rdquo; said Captain Fennel.</p>

<p>His wife called after him to bring down the
dominoes also; some one might like a game. The
captain did not intend to take the trouble of going
himself; he meant to send Flore. But Flore was not
in the kitchen, and he took it for granted she was upstairs.
In fact, Flore was in the yard at the pump;
but he never thought of the yard or the pump.
Lighting a candle, he strode upstairs.</p>

<p>He was coming down again, the open box of
dominoes and Charley Palliser&rsquo;s book in one hand, the
candlestick in the other, when the same sort of thing
seemed to occur which had occurred on Sunday night.
Hearing, as he thought, some one close behind him,
almost treading, as it were, upon his heels, and thinking
it was Flore, he turned his head round, intending
to tell her to keep her distance.</p>

<p>Then, with a frightful yell, down dashed Captain
Fennel the few remaining stairs, the book, the candlestick,
and the box of dominoes all falling in the passage
from his nerveless hands. The dominoes were hard
and strong, and made a great crash. But it was the
yell which had frightened the company in the salon.</p>

<p>They flocked out in doubt and wonder. The candle
had gone out; and Charley Palliser was bringing
forth the lamp to light up the darkness, when he was
nearly knocked down by Captain Fennel. Flore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
returning from the pump with her own candle, much
damaged by the air of the yard, held it up to survey
the scene.</p>

<p>Captain Fennel swept past Charley into the salon,
and threw himself into a chair behind the door, after
trying to dash it to; but they were trooping in behind
him. His breath was short, his terrified face looked
livid as one meet for the grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what has happened to you, sir?&rdquo; asked
Charles, intensely surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! he must have seen the thief again!&rdquo; shrieked
Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut the door; bolt it!&rdquo; called out the stricken
man.</p>

<p>They did as they were bid. This order, as it
struck them all, could only have reference to keeping
out some nefarious intruder, such as a thief. Flore
had followed them in, after picking up the débris.
She put the book and the dominoes on the table, and
stood staring over her mistress&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the thief got in again, Edwin?&rdquo; repeated
Mrs. Fennel, who was beginning to tremble. &ldquo;Did
you see him?&mdash;or hear him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My foot slipped; it sent me headforemost down
the stairs,&rdquo; spoke the captain at last, conscious, perhaps,
that something must be said to satisfy the inquisitive
faces around him. &ldquo;I heard Flore behind me,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not me, sir,&rdquo; put in Flore in her best English. &ldquo;I
was not upstairs at all; I was out at the pump. There
is nobody upstairs, sir; there can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo; But Captain
Fennel only glared at her in answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you cry out at?&rdquo; asked Charles Palliser,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
speaking soothingly, for he saw that the man was
pitiably unstrung. &ldquo;Have you had a thief in the
house? Did you think you saw one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw no thief; there has been no thief in the
house that I know of; I tell you I slipped&mdash;and it
startled me,&rdquo; retorted the captain, his tones becoming
savage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;why did you have the door bolted, captain?&rdquo;
struck in Miss Stella Featherston, who was extremely
practical and matter-of-fact, and who could not understand
the scene at all.</p>

<p>This time the captain glared at <em>her</em>. Only for a
moment; a sickly smile then stole over his countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody here talked about a thief: I said bolt
him out,&rdquo; answered he.</p>

<p>With this general explanation they had to be contented;
but to none of them did it sound natural or
straightforward.</p>

<p>Order was restored. The ladies took a glass of wine
each and some of the gâteau, which Flore handed
round. Charles Palliser said good-night and departed
with his book. Captain Fennel went out at
the same time. He turned into the café on the Place
Ronde, and drank three small glasses of cognac in
succession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nancy, what did you mean by talking about a
thief?&rdquo; began Madame Carimon, the whole thing
much exercising her mind.</p>

<p>Upon which, Mrs. Fennel treated them all, including
Flore, to an elaborate account of her husband&rsquo;s fright
on the Sunday night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was on the stairs; just as it was again now,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;He thought he heard some one following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
behind him as he came up to bed. He fancied it was
Flore; but Flore had left hours before. I never saw
any one show such terror in all my life. He said it
was Flore behind him to-night, and you saw how
terrified he was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if he took it to be Flore, why should he be
frightened?&rdquo; returned Mary Carimon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, mesdames, but it is the same argument I
made bold to use to madame,&rdquo; interposed Flore from
the background, where she stood. &ldquo;There is not anything
in me to give people fright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;think&mdash;it must have been,&rdquo; said Mrs. Fennel,
speaking slowly, &ldquo;that he grew alarmed when he
found it was not Flore he saw. Both times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then who was it that he did see&mdash;to startle him
like that?&rdquo; asked Mary Carimon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he must have thought it was a thief,&rdquo; replied
Nancy. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this juncture the argument was brought to a
close by the entrance of Monsieur Jules Carimon, who
had come to escort his wife and Stella Featherston
home.</p>

<p>These curious attacks of terror were repeated; not
often, but at a few days&rsquo; interval; so that at length
Captain Fennel took care not to go about the house
alone in the dark. He went up to bed when his wife
did; he would not go to the door, if a ring came after
Flore&rsquo;s departure, without a light in his hand. By-and-by
he improvised a lamp, which he kept on the
slab.</p>

<p>What was it that he was scared at? An impression
arose in the minds of the two or three people who
were privy to this, that he saw, or fancied he saw, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the house the spectre of one who had just been carried
out of it, Lavinia Preen. Nancy had no such suspicion
as yet; she only thought her husband could not be
well. She was much occupied about that time, having
at length nerved herself to the task of looking over
her poor sister&rsquo;s effects.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when sitting in Lavinia&rsquo;s room (Flore&mdash;who
stayed with her for company&mdash;had run down
to the kitchen to see that the dinner did not burn),
Nancy came upon a small, thin green case. Between
its leaves she found three one-hundred-franc notes&mdash;twelve
pounds in English value. She rightly judged
that it was all that remained of her sister&rsquo;s nest-egg,
and that she had intended to take it with her to
Boulogne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Lavinia!&rdquo; she aspirated, the tears dropping
from her eyes. &ldquo;Every farthing remaining of the
quarter&rsquo;s money she left with me for housekeeping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But now a thought came to Nancy. Placing the
case on the floor near her, intending to show it to her
husband&mdash;she was sitting on a stool before one of
Lavinia&rsquo;s boxes&mdash;it suddenly occurred to her that it
might be as well to say nothing to him about it. He
would be sure to appropriate the money to his own
private uses: and Nancy knew that she should need
some for hers. There would be her mourning to pay
for; and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The room-door was wide open, and at this point in
her reflections Nancy heard the captain enter the
house with his latch-key, and march straight upstairs.
In hasty confusion, she thrust the little case into the
nearest hiding-place, which happened to be the front
of her black dress bodice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nancy, I have to go to England,&rdquo; cried the captain.
&ldquo;How hot you look! Can&rsquo;t you manage to do that
without stooping?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To go to England!&rdquo; repeated Nancy, lifting her
flushed face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a letter from my brother; the postman gave
it me as I was crossing the Place Ronde. It&rsquo;s only a
line or two,&rdquo; he added, tossing it to her. &ldquo;I must
take this evening&rsquo;s boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy read the letter. Only a line or two, as he
said, just telling the captain to go over with all speed
upon a pressing matter of business, and that he could
return before the week was ended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, Edwin, you can&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; began Nancy, in
alarm. &ldquo;I cannot stay here by myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not go! Why, I must go,&rdquo; he said very decisively.
&ldquo;How do I know what it is that I am wanted for?
Perhaps that property which we are always expecting
to fall in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I should be so lonely. I could not stay here
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; he sharply answered. &ldquo;I shall not
be away above one clear day; two days at the
furthest. This is Thursday, and I shall return by
Sunday&rsquo;s boat. You will only be alone to-morrow
and Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned away, thus putting an end to the discussion,
and entered their own room. As Nancy
looked after him in despair, it suddenly struck her
how very thin and ill he had become; his face worn
and grey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wants a change,&rdquo; she said to herself; &ldquo;our
trouble here has upset him as much as it did me. I&rsquo;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
say no more; I must not be selfish. Poor Lavinia
used to warn me against selfishness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Captain Fennel went off without further opposition,
his wife enjoining him to be sure to return on
Sunday. The steamer was starting that night at
eight o&rsquo;clock; it was a fine evening, and Nancy
walked down to the port with her husband and saw
him on board. Nancy met an acquaintance down
there; no other than Charley Palliser. They strolled
a little in the wake of the departing steamer; Charley
then saw her as far as the Place Ronde, and there
wished her good-night.</p>

<p>And now an extraordinary thing happened. As
Mrs. Fennel opened the door with her latch-key, Flore
having left, and was about to enter the dark passage,
the same curious and unaccountable terror seized her
which had been wont to attack Lavinia. Leaving the
door wide open, she dashed up the passage, felt for
the match-box, and struck a light. Then, candle in
hand, she returned to shut the door; but her whole
frame trembled with fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s just what poor Lavinia felt!&rdquo; she
gasped. &ldquo;What on earth can it be? Why should it
come to me? I will take care not to go out to-morrow
night or Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she held to her decision. Mrs. Hardy sent
Charley Palliser to invite her for either day, or both
days; Mary Carimon sent Pauline with a note to the
same effect; but Nancy returned a refusal in both
cases, with her best thanks.</p>

<p>The boat came in on Sunday night, but it did not
bring Captain Fennel. On the Sunday morning the
post had brought Nancy a few lines from him, saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
he found the business on which he had been called to
London was of great importance, and he was obliged
to remain another day or two.</p>

<p>Nancy was frightfully put out: not only vexed, but
angry. Edwin had no business to leave her alone
like that so soon after Lavinia&rsquo;s death. She bemoaned
her hard fate to several friends on coming out of
church, and Mrs. Smith carried her off to dinner. The
major was not out that morning&mdash;a twinge of gout in
the right foot had kept him indoors.</p>

<p>This involved Nancy&rsquo;s going home alone in the
evening, for the major could not walk with her. She
did not like it. The same horror came over her before
opening the door. She entered somehow, and dashed
into the kitchen, hoping the stove was alight: a very
silly hope, for Flore had been gone since the afternoon.</p>

<p>Nancy lighted the candle in the kitchen, and then
fancied she saw some one looking at her from the open
kitchen-door. It looked like Lavinia. It certainly
<em>was</em> Lavinia. Nancy stood spell-bound; then she gave
a cry of desperate horror and dropped the candlestick.</p>

<p>How she picked it up she never knew; the light
had not gone out. Nothing was to be seen then. The
apparition, if it had been one, had vanished. She got
up to bed somehow, and lay shivering under the bedclothes
until morning.</p>

<p>Quite early, when Nancy was at breakfast, Madame
Carimon came in. She had already been to the fish-market,
and came on to invite Nancy to her house for
the day, having heard that Mr. Fennel was still absent.
With a scared face and trembling lips, Nancy told her
about the previous night&mdash;the strange horror of entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
which had begun to attack her, the figure of
Lavinia at the kitchen-door.</p>

<p>Madame Carimon, listening gravely, took, or
appeared to take, a sensible view of it. &ldquo;You have
caught up this fear of entering the house, Nancy,
through remembering that it attacked poor Lavinia,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Impressionable minds&mdash;and yours is one
of them&mdash;take fright just as children catch measles.
As to thinking you saw Lavinia&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had on the gown she wore the Sunday she
was taken ill: her silver-grey silk, you know,&rdquo; interrupted
Nancy. &ldquo;She looked at me with a mournful,
appealing gaze, just as if she wanted something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, you were just in the mood to fancy something
of the kind,&rdquo; lightly spoke Madame Carimon. &ldquo;The
fright of coming in had done that for you. I dare
say you had been talking of Lavinia at Major Smith&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so we had,&rdquo; confessed Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so; she was already on your mind, and
therefore that and the fright you were in caused you
to fancy you saw her. Nancy, my dear, you cannot
imagine the foolish illusions our fancies play us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Easily persuaded, Mrs. Fennel agreed that it might
have been so. She strove to forget the matter, and
went out there and then with Mary Carimon.</p>

<p>But this state of things was to continue. Captain
Fennel did not return, and Nancy grew frightened to
death at being alone in the house after dark. Flore
was unable to stay longer than the time originally
agreed for, her old mother being dangerously ill. As
dusk approached, Nancy began to hate her destiny.
Apart from nervousness, she was sociably inclined,
and yearned for company. Now and again the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
inclination to accept an invitation was too strong to
be resisted, or she went out after dinner, uninvited, to
this friend or that. But the pleasure was counterbalanced
by having to go in again at night; the
horror clung to her.</p>

<p>If a servant attended her home, or any gentleman
from the house where she had been, she made them
go indoors with her whilst she lighted her candle;
once she got Monsieur Gustave&rsquo;s errand-boy to do so.
But it was almost as bad with the lighted candle&mdash;the
first feeling of being in the lonely house after they
had gone. She wrote letter after letter, imploring her
husband to return. Captain Fennel&rsquo;s replies were
rich in promises: he would be back the very instant
business permitted; probably &ldquo;to-morrow, or the
next day.&rdquo; But he did not come.</p>

<p>One Sunday, when he had been gone about three
weeks, and Nancy had been spending the day in the
Rue Pomme Cuite, Mary Carimon walked home with
her in the evening. Monsieur Jules had gone to see
his cousin off by the nine-o&rsquo;clock train&mdash;Mademoiselle
Priscille Carimon, who had come in to spend the day
with them. She lived at Drecques.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will come in with me, Mary?&rdquo; said Ann
Fennel, as they gained the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure I will,&rdquo; replied Madame Carimon,
laughing lightly, for none knew about the fears better
than she.</p>

<p>Nancy took her hand as they went up the passage.
She lighted the candle at the slab, and they went into
the salon. Madame Carimon sat down for a few
minutes, by way of reassuring her. Nancy took off
her bonnet and mantle. On the table was a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
tray with the tea-things upon it. Flore had left it
there in readiness, not quite certain whether her
mistress would come in to tea or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had such a curious dream last night,&rdquo; began
Nancy; &ldquo;those tea-things put me in mind of it.
Lavinia&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake don&rsquo;t begin upon dreams to-night!&rdquo;
interposed Madame Carimon. &ldquo;You know
they always frighten you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but this was a pleasant dream, Mary. I
thought that I and Lavinia were seated at a little
table, with two teacups between us full of tea. The
cups were very pretty; pale amber with gilt scrolls,
and the china so thin as to be transparent. I can see
them now. And Lavinia said something which made
me smile; but I don&rsquo;t remember what it was. Ah,
Mary! if she were only back again with us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is better off, you know,&rdquo; said Mary Carimon
in tender tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the same, it was a cruel fate that took her; I
shall never think otherwise. I wish I knew what
it was she died of! Flore told me one day that
Monsieur Podevin quite laughed at the idea of its
being a chill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Nancy, it was you who stopped it, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stopped what?&rdquo; asked Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The investigation the doctors would have made
after death. Both of them were much put out at
your forbidding it: for their own satisfaction they
wished to ascertain particulars. I may tell you now
that I thought you were wrong to interfere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Captain Fennel,&rdquo; said Nancy calmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Fennel!&rdquo; echoed Mary Carimon. &ldquo;Monsieur
Dupuis told me that Captain Fennel wished for
it as much as he and Monsieur Podevin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Fennel&rsquo;s wife shook her head. &ldquo;They
asked him about it before they left, after she died.
He came to me, and I said, Oh, let them do what they
would; it could not hurt her now she was dead. I
was in such terrible distress, Mary, that I hardly
knew or cared what I said. Then Edwin drew so
dreadful a picture of what post-mortems are, and how
barbarously her poor neck and arms would be cut and
slashed, that I grew sick and frightened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you stopped it&mdash;by reason of the picture
he drew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I came running down here to Monsieur
Dupuis&mdash;Monsieur Podevin had gone&mdash;for Edwin said
it must be my decision, not his, and his name had
better not be mentioned; and I begged and prayed
Monsieur Dupuis not to hold it. I think I startled
him, good old man. I was almost out of my mind;
quite wild with agitation; and he promised me it
should be as I wished. That&rsquo;s how it all was,
Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Carimon&rsquo;s face wore a curious look. Then
she rallied, speaking even lightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well; it could not have brought her back
to life; and I repeat that we must remember she is
better off. And now, Nancy, I want you to show me
the pretty purse that Miss Perry has knitted for you,
if you have it at hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy rose, opened her workbox, which stood on
the side-table, and brought forth the purse. Of
course Madame Carimon&rsquo;s motive had been to change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
her thoughts. After admiring the purse, and talking
of other pleasant matters, Mary took her departure.</p>

<p>And the moment the outer door had closed upon
her that feeling of terror seized upon Nancy. Catching
up her mantle with one hand and the candle with
the other, she made for the staircase, leaving her
bonnet and gloves in the salon. The staircase struck
cold to her, and she could hear the wind whistling,
for it was a windy night. As to the candle, it seemed
to burn with a pale flame and not to give half its
usual light.</p>

<p>In her nervous agitation, just as she gained the
uppermost stair, she dropped her mantle. Raising her
head from stooping to pick it up, she suddenly saw
some figure before her at the end of the passage. It
stood beyond the door of her own room, close to that
which had been her sister&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>It was Lavinia. She appeared to be habited in the
silver-grey silk already spoken of. Her gaze was
fixed upon Nancy, with the same imploring aspect of
appeal, as if she wanted something; her pale face was
inexpressibly mournful. With a terrible cry, Nancy
tore into her own room, the mantle trailing after her.
She shut the door and bolted it, and buried her face
in the counterpane in wild agony.</p>

<p>And in that moment a revelation came to Ann
Fennel. It was this apparition which had been wont
to haunt her husband in the house and terrify him
beyond control. Not a thief; not Flore&mdash;but Lavinia!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>


<h3>XV.</h3>

<p>On the Monday morning Flore found her mistress in
so sick and suffering and strange a state, that she sent
for Madame Carimon. In vain Mary Carimon, after
hearing Nancy&rsquo;s tale, strove to convince her that what
she saw was fancy, the effect of diseased nerves.
Nancy was more obstinate than a mule.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I saw was Lavinia,&rdquo; she shivered. &ldquo;Lavinia&rsquo;s
apparition. No good to tell me it was not; I have
seen it now twice. It was as clear and evident to me,
both times, as ever she herself was in life. That&rsquo;s
what Edwin used to see; I know it now; and he
became unable to bear the house. I seem to read it
all as in a book, Mary. He got his brother to send
for him, and he is staying away because he dreads to
come back again. But you know I cannot stay here
alone now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Carimon wrote off at once to Captain
Fennel, Nancy supplying the address. She told him
that his wife was ill; in a nervous state; fancying
she saw Lavinia in the house. Such a report, she
added, should if possible be kept from spreading to
the town, and therefore she must advise him to return
without delay.</p>

<p>The letter brought back Captain Fennel, Flore
having meanwhile remained entirely at the Petite
Maison Rouge. Perhaps the captain did not in secret
like that little remark of its being well to keep it from
the public; he may have considered it suggestive,
coming from Mary Carimon. He believed she read
him pretty correctly, and he hated her accordingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Any way, he deemed it well to be on the spot. Left
to herself, there was no telling what ridiculous things
Nancy might be saying or fancying.</p>

<p>Edwin Fennel did not return alone. His brother&rsquo;s
wife was with him. Mrs. James, they called her,
James being the brother&rsquo;s Christian name. Mrs.
James was not a lady in herself or in manner; but
she was lively and very good-natured, and these
qualities were what the Petite Maison Rouge wanted
in it just now; and perhaps that was Captain Fennel&rsquo;s
motive in bringing her. Nancy was delighted. She
almost forgot her fears and fancies. Flore was agreeable
also, for she was now at liberty to return to
ordinary arrangements. Thus there was a lull in the
storm. They walked out with Mrs. James on the
pier, and took her to see the different points of interest
in the town; they even gave a little soirée for her,
and in return were invited to other houses.</p>

<p>One day, when the two ladies were gossiping
together, Nancy, in the openness of her heart, related
to Mrs. James the particulars of Lavinia&rsquo;s unexpected
and rather mysterious death, and of her appearing in
the house again after it. Captain Fennel disturbed
them in the midst of the story. His wife was taking
his name in vain at the moment of his entrance,
saying how scared <em>he</em> had been at the apparition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your peace, you foolish woman!&rdquo; he
thundered, looking as if he meant to strike her.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble Mrs. James&rsquo;s head with such miserable
rubbish as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. James did not appear to mind it. She burst
into a hearty laugh. She never had seen a ghost, she
said, and was sure she never should; there were no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
such things. But she should like to hear all about
poor Miss Preen&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was nothing else to hear,&rdquo; the captain
growled. &ldquo;She caught a chill on the Sunday, coming
out of the hot church after morning service. It struck
inwardly, bringing on inflammation, which the medical
men could not subdue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you know, Edwin, the church never is hot,
and you know the doctors decided it was not a chill.
Monsieur Podevin especially denied it,&rdquo; dissented
Nancy, who possessed about as much insight as a
goose, and a little less tact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what did she die of?&rdquo; questioned Mrs. James.
&ldquo;Was she poisoned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how can you suggest so dreadful a thing!&rdquo;
shrieked Nancy. &ldquo;Poisoned! Who would be so
wicked as to poison Lavinia? Every one loved her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which again amused the listening lady. &ldquo;You
have a quick imagination, Mrs. Edwin,&rdquo; she laughed.
&ldquo;I was thinking of mushrooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I of tinned meats and copper saucepans,&rdquo;
supplemented Captain Fennel. &ldquo;However, there
could be no suspicion even of that sort in Lavinia&rsquo;s
case, since she had touched nothing but what we all
partook of. She died of inflammation, Mrs. James.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little doubt of it,&rdquo; acquiesced Mrs. James. &ldquo;A
friend of mine went, not twelve months ago, to a
funeral at Brompton Cemetery; the ground was damp,
and she caught a chill. In four days she was dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women have no business at funerals,&rdquo; growled
Edwin Fennel. &ldquo;Why should they parade their grief
abroad? You see nothing of the kind in France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In truth I think you are not far wrong,&rdquo; said Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
James. &ldquo;It is a fashion which has sprung up of late.
A few years ago it was as much unknown with us as
it is with the French.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>They</em> will be catching it up next, I suppose,&rdquo;
retorted the captain, as if the thing were a personal
grievance to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little doubt of it,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. James.</p>

<p>After staying at Sainteville for a month, Mrs. James
Fennel took her departure for London. Captain
Fennel proposed to escort her over; but his wife went
into so wild a state at the mere mention of it, that he
had to give it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare not stay in the house by myself, Edwin,&rdquo;
she shuddered. &ldquo;I should go to the Vice-Consul and
to other influential people here, and tell them of my
misery&mdash;that I am afraid of seeing Lavinia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Captain Fennel believed she would be capable
of doing it. So he remained with her.</p>

<p>That the spectre of the dead-and-gone Lavinia did
at times appear to them, or else their fancies conjured
up the vision, was all too certain. Three times during
the visit of Mrs. James the captain had been betrayed
into one of his fits of terror: no need to ask what had
caused it. After her departure the same thing took
place. Nancy had not again seen anything, but she
knew he had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall not be able to stay in the house, Edwin,&rdquo;
his wife said to him one evening when they were
sitting in the salon at dusk after Flore&rsquo;s departure;
nothing having led up to the remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy we should be as well out of it,&rdquo; replied he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Edwin, let us go! If we can! There will be
all the rent to pay up first.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All the what?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rent,&rdquo; repeated Nancy; &ldquo;up to the end of
the term we took it for. About three years longer,
I think, Edwin. That would be sixty pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where do you suppose the sixty pounds
would come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. There&rsquo;s the impediment, you see,&rdquo;
remarked Nancy blankly. &ldquo;We cannot leave without
paying up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless we made a moonlight flitting of it, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I never will,&rdquo; she rejoined, with a firmness
he could not mistake. &ldquo;You are only jesting, Edwin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be no jesting matter to pay up that
claim, and others; for there are others. Our better
plan, Nancy, will be to go off by the London boat
some night, and not let any one know where we are
until I can come back to pay. You may see it is the
only thing to be done, and you must bring your mind
to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never by me,&rdquo; said Nancy, strong in her innate
rectitude. &ldquo;As to hiding ourselves anywhere, that
can never be; I should not conceal my address from
Mary Carimon&mdash;I <em>could</em> not conceal it from Colonel
Selby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Fennel ground his teeth. &ldquo;Suppose I say
that this shall be, that we will go, and order you to
obey me? What then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Edwin, I could not. I should go in to
Monsieur Gustave Sauvage, and say to him, &lsquo;We were
thinking of running away, but I cannot do it; please
put me in prison until I can pay the debt.&rsquo; And
then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you an idiot?&rdquo; asked Captain Fennel, staring
at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then, when I was in prison,&rdquo; went on Nancy,
&ldquo;I should write to tell William Selby; and perhaps
he would come over and release me. Please don&rsquo;t
talk in this kind of way again, Edwin. I should keep
my word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Edwin Fennel could not have felt more astounded
had his wife then and there turned into a
dromedary before his eyes. She had hitherto been
tractable as a child. But he had never tried her in
a thing that touched her honour, and he saw that the
card which he had intended to play was lost.</p>

<p>Captain Fennel played another. He went away
himself.</p>

<p>Making the best he could of the house and its
haunted state (though day by day saw him looking
more and more like a walking skeleton) throughout
the greater part of June, for the summer had come in,
he despatched his wife to Pontipette one market day&mdash;Saturday&mdash;to
remain there until the following
Wednesday. Old Mrs. Hardy had gone to the homely
but comfortable hotel at Pontipette for a change, and
she wrote to invite Nancy to stay a short time with
her. Charles Palliser was in England. Captain Fennel
proceeded to London by that same Saturday night&rsquo;s
boat, armed with a letter from his wife to Colonel
Selby, requesting the colonel to pay over to her
husband her quarterly instalment instead of sending
it to herself. Captain Fennel had bidden her do this;
and Nancy, of strict probity in regard to other people&rsquo;s
money, could not resist signing over her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will be sure to bring it all back, won&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
you, Edwin? and to be here by Wednesday, the day
I return?&rdquo; she said to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I shall, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a double portion now&mdash;thirty-five
pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a good thing, too; we shall want it,&rdquo; he
returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes; there&rsquo;s such a heap of things owing
for,&rdquo; concluded Nancy.</p>

<p>Thus the captain went over to England in great
glee, carrying with him the order for the money. But
he was reckoning without his host.</p>

<p>Upon presenting himself at the bank in the City on
Monday morning, he found Colonel Selby absent; not
expected to return before the end of that week, or the
beginning of the next. This was a check for Captain
Fennel. He quite glared at the gentleman who thus
informed him&mdash;Mr. West, who sat in the colonel&rsquo;s
room, and was his locum tenens for the time
being.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Business is transacted all the same, I conclude?&rdquo;
said he snappishly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; replied Mr. West, marvelling at
the absurdity of the question. &ldquo;What can I do for
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Fennel produced his wife&rsquo;s letter, requesting
that her quarter&rsquo;s money should be paid over to
him, and handed in her receipt for the same. Mr.
West read them both, the letter twice, and then
looked direct through his silver-rimmed spectacles at
the applicant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot do this,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it is a private matter
of Colonel Selby&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not more private than any other payment
you may have to make,&rdquo; retorted Captain Fennel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, it is. This really does not concern
the bank at all. I cannot pay it without Colonel
Selby&rsquo;s authority: he has neither given it nor mentioned
it to me. Another thing: the payment, as I
gather from the wording of Mrs. Ann Fennel&rsquo;s letter,
is not yet due. Upon that score, apart from any
other, I should decline to pay it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be due in two or three days. Colonel Selby
would not object to forestall the time by that short
period.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would, of course, be for the colonel&rsquo;s own
consideration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I particularly wish to receive the money this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. West shook his head in answer. &ldquo;If you will
leave Mrs. Fennel&rsquo;s letter and receipt in my charge,
sir, I will place them before the colonel as soon as he
returns. That is all I can do. Or perhaps you would
prefer to retain the latter,&rdquo; he added, handing back
the receipt over the desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Business men are the very devil to stick at
straws,&rdquo; muttered Captain Fennel under his breath.
He saw it was no use trying to move the one before
him, and went out, saying he would call in a day or
two.</p>

<p>Now it happened that Colonel Selby, who was only
staying at Brighton for a rest (for he had been very
unwell of late), took a run up to town that same
Monday morning to see his medical attendant. His
visit paid, he went on to the bank, surprising Mr.
West there about one o&rsquo;clock. After some conference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
upon business matters, Mr. West spoke of Captain
Fennel&rsquo;s visit, and handed over the letter he had left.</p>

<p>Colonel Selby drew in his lips as he read it. He
did not like Mr. Edwin Fennel; and he would most
assuredly not pay Ann Fennel&rsquo;s money to him. He
returned the letter to Mr. West.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should the man come here again, West, tell him,
as you did this morning, that he can see me on my
return&mdash;which will probably be on this day week,&rdquo;
said the colonel. &ldquo;No need to say I have been up
here to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And on the following day, Tuesday, Colonel Selby,
being then at Brighton, drew out a cheque for the
quarter almost due and sent it by post to Nancy at
Sainteville.</p>

<p>Thus checkmated in regard to the money, Captain
Fennel did not return home at the time he promised,
even if he had had any intention of doing so. When
Nancy returned to Sainteville on the Wednesday from
Pontipette, he was not there. The first thing she saw
waiting for her on the table was Colonel Selby&rsquo;s letter
containing the cheque for five-and-thirty pounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How glad I am it has come to me so soon!&rdquo; cried
Nancy; &ldquo;I can pay the bills now. I suppose William
Selby thinks it would not be legal to pay it to Edwin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The week went on. Each time a boat came in,
Nancy was promenading the port, expecting to see
her husband land from it. On the Sunday morning
Nancy received a letter from him, in which he told
her he was waiting to see Colonel Selby, to get the
money paid to him. Nancy wrote back hastily, saying
it had been received by herself, and that she had
paid it nearly all away in settling the bills. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
begged him to come back by the next boat. Flore
was staying in the house altogether, but at an
inconvenience.</p>

<p>On the Monday evening Mrs. Fennel had another
desperate fright. She went to take tea with an
elderly lady and her daughter, Mrs. and Miss Lambert,
bidding Flore to come for her at half-past nine o&rsquo;clock.
Half-past nine came, but no Flore; ten o&rsquo;clock came,
and then Mrs. Fennel set off alone, supposing Flore
had misunderstood her and would be found waiting
for her at home. The moonlit streets were crowded
with promenaders returning from their summer evening
walk upon the pier.</p>

<p>Nancy rang the bell; but it was not answered.
She had her latch-key in her pocket, but preferred
to be admitted, and she rang again. No one came.
&ldquo;Flore must have dropped asleep in the kitchen,&rdquo; she
petulantly thought, and drew out her key.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flore!&rdquo; she called out, pushing the door back.
&ldquo;Flore, where are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flore apparently was nowhere, very much to the
dismay of Mrs. Fennel. She would have to go in
alone, all down the dark passage, and wake her up.
Leaving the door wide open, she advanced in the
dark with cautious steps, the old terror full upon
her.</p>

<p>The kitchen was dark also, so far as fire or candlelight
went, but a glimmer of moonlight shone in at
the window. &ldquo;Are you not here, Flore?&rdquo; shivered
Nancy. But there was no response.</p>

<p>Groping for the match-box on the mantel-shelf
over the stove, and not at once finding it, Nancy
suddenly took up an impression that some one was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
standing in the misty rays of the moon. Gazing
attentively, it seemed to assume the shadowy form of
Lavinia. And with a shuddering cry Nancy Fennel
fell down upon the brick floor of the kitchen.</p>


<h3>XVI.</h3>

<p>It was a lovely summer&rsquo;s day, and Madame Carimon&rsquo;s
neat little slip of a kitchen was bright and hot with
the morning sun. Madame, herself, stood before the
paste-board, making a green-apricot tart. Of pies
and tarts à la mode Anglaise, Monsieur Jules was
more fond than a schoolboy; and of all tarts known
to the civilized world, none can equal that of a green
apricot.</p>

<p>Madame had put down the rolling-pin, and stood
for the moment idle, looking at Flore Pamart, and
listening to something that Flore was saying. Flore,
whisking out of the Petite Maison Rouge a few
minutes before, ostensibly to do her morning&rsquo;s marketings,
had whisked straight off to the Rue Pomme
Cuite, and was now seated at the corner of the pastry-table,
telling a story to Madame Carimon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was madame&rsquo;s own fault,&rdquo; she broke off in her
tale to remark. &ldquo;Madame <em>will</em> give me her orders
in French, and half the time I can&rsquo;t understand them.
She had an engagement to take tea at Madame Smith&rsquo;s
in the Rue Lambeau, was what I thought she said to
me, and that I must present myself there at half-past
nine to walk home with her. Well, madame, I went
accordingly, and found nobody at home there but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
bonne, Thomasine. Her master was dining out at the
Sous-préfet&rsquo;s, and her mistress had gone out with some
more ladies to walk on the pier, as it was so fine an
evening. Naturally I thought my mistress was one
of the ladies, and sat there waiting for her and chatting
with Thomasine. Madame Smith came in at ten
o&rsquo;clock, and then she said that my lady had not been
there and that she had not expected her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must have gone to tea elsewhere,&rdquo; observed
Madame Carimon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clearly, madame; as I afterwards found. It was
to Madame Lambert&rsquo;s, in the Rue Lothaire, that I
ought to have gone. I could only go home, as madame
sees; and when I arrived there I found the house-door
wide open. Just as I entered, a frightful cry came
from the kitchen, and there I found her dropped
down on the floor, half senseless with terror. Madame,
she avowed to me that she had seen Mademoiselle
Lavinia standing near her in the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Carimon took up her rolling-pin slowly
before she spoke. &ldquo;I know she has a fancy that she
appears in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame Carimon, I think she <em>is</em> in the house,&rdquo;
said Flore solemnly. And for a minute or two Madame
Carimon rolled her paste in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Fennel used to see her&mdash;I am sure he
did&mdash;and now his wife sees her,&rdquo; went on the woman.
&ldquo;I think that is the secret of his running away so
much: he can&rsquo;t bear the house and what is haunting
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is altogether a dreadful thing; I lie awake
thinking of it,&rdquo; bewailed Mary Carimon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it cannot be let go on like this,&rdquo; said Flore;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
&ldquo;and that&rsquo;s what has brought me running here this
morning&mdash;to ask you, madame, whether anything can
be done. If she is left alone to see these sights, she&rsquo;ll
die of it. When she got up this morning she was
shivering like a leaf in the wind. Has madame
noticed that she is wasting away? For the matter
of that, so was Monsieur Fennel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Carimon, beginning to line her shallow
dish with paste, nodded in assent. &ldquo;He ought to be
here with her,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch him,&rdquo; returned Flore, in a heat. &ldquo;Pardon,
madame, but I must avow I trust not that gentleman.
He is no good. He will never come back to stay at
the house so long as there is in it&mdash;what is there. He
dare not; and I would like to ask him why not. A
man with the conscience at ease could not be that sort
of coward. Honest men do not fly away, all scared,
when they fancy they see a revenant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deeming it might be unwise to pursue the topic
from this point, Madame Carimon said she would go
and see Mrs. Fennel in the course of the day, and
Flore clattered off, her wooden shoes echoing on the
narrow pavement of the Rue Pomme Cuite.</p>

<p>But, as Madame Carimon was crossing the Place
Ronde in the afternoon to pay her visit, she met Mrs.
Fennel. Of course, Flore&rsquo;s communication was not to
be mentioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Madame Carimon readily, &ldquo;is it you?
I was coming to ask if you would like to take a walk
on the pier with me. It is a lovely afternoon, and
not too hot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;I came out because it
is so miserable at home. When Flore went off to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
fish-market after breakfast, I felt more lonely than
you would believe. Mary,&rdquo; dropping her voice, &ldquo;I
saw Lavinia last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I won&rsquo;t listen to that,&rdquo; retorted Mary Carimon,
as if she were reprimanding a child. &ldquo;Once give in
to our nerves and fancies, there&rsquo;s no end to the tricks
they play us. I wish, Ann, your house were in a
more lively situation, where you might sit at the
window and watch the passers-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Nancy sensibly. &ldquo;It looks upon
nothing but the walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walking on, they sat down upon a bench that
stood back from the port, facing the harbour. Nearly
opposite lay the English boat, busily loading for
London. The sight made Nancy sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish it would bring Edwin the next time it
comes in,&rdquo; she said in low tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do you expect him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know <em>when</em>,&rdquo; said poor Nancy with
emphasis. &ldquo;Mary, I am beginning to think he stays
away because he is afraid of seeing Lavinia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men are not afraid of those foolish things, Ann.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is. Recollect those fits of terror he had. He
used to hear her following him up and downstairs;
used to see her on the landings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Carimon found no ready answer. She had
witnessed one of those fits of terror herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Fennel, after a pause,
&ldquo;when Flore had left me and I could only shiver in
my bed, and not expect to sleep, I became calm enough
to ask myself <em>why</em> Lavinia should come back again,
and what it is she wants. Can you think why,
Mary?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Madame Carimon lightly. &ldquo;I shall
only believe she does come when she shows herself
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I happened on the thought that, possibly, she
may be wanting us to inquire into the true cause of
her death. It might have been ascertained at the
time, but for my stopping the action of the doctors,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ann, my dear, you should exercise a little common
sense. I would ask you what end ascertaining it now
would answer, to her, dead, or to you, living?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be seen that she could have been cured,
had we only known what the malady was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did not know; the doctors did not know.
It could only have been discovered, even at your
showing, after her death, not in time to save her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish Monsieur Dupuis had come more quickly
on the Monday night!&rdquo; sighed Nancy. &ldquo;I am always
wishing it. You can picture what it was, Mary&mdash;Lavinia
lying in that dreadful agony and no doctor
coming near her. Edwin was gone so long&mdash;so long!
He could not wake up Monsieur Dupuis. I think now
that the bell was out of order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you think that now? Captain Fennel
must have known whether the bell answered to his
summons, or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Nancy, &ldquo;this morning when Flore
returned with the fish, she said I looked very ill. She
had just seen Monsieur Dupuis in the Place Ronde,
and she ran out again and brought him in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you mention to him this fancy of seeing
Lavinia?&rdquo; hastily interrupted Madame Carimon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; I don&rsquo;t talk of that to people. Only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
you and Flore; and&mdash;yes&mdash;I did tell Mrs. Smith. I
let Monsieur Dupuis think I was ill with grieving
after Lavinia, and we talked a little about her. I said
how I wished he could have been here sooner on the
Monday night, and that my husband had rung several
times before he could arouse him. Monsieur Dupuis
said that was a mistake; he had got up and come as
soon as he was called; he was not asleep at the time,
and the bell had rung only once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an extraordinary thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary
Carimon. &ldquo;I know your husband said he rang many
times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I now think the bell must have been
out of order; but I did not say so to Monsieur
Dupuis,&rdquo; returned Nancy. &ldquo;He is a kind old man,
and it would grieve him: for of course we know
doctors <em>ought</em> to keep their door-bells in order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Carimon rose in silence, but full of thought,
and they continued their walk. It was low water in
the harbour, but the sun was sparkling and playing on
the waves out at sea. On the pier they found Rose
and Anna Bosanquet; and in chatting with them
Nancy&rsquo;s mood became more cheerful.</p>

<p>That same evening, on that same pier, Mary Carimon
spoke a few confidential words to her husband. They
sat at the end of it, and the beauty of the night, so
warm and still, induced them to linger. The bright
moon sailed grandly in the heavens and glittered upon
the water that now filled the harbour, for the tide was
in. Most of the promenaders had turned down the
pier again, after watching out the steamer. What a
fine passage she would make, and was making, cutting
there so smoothly through the crystal sea!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary Carimon began in a low voice, though no one
was near to listen and the waves could not hear her.
She spoke pretty fully of a haunting doubt that lay
upon her mind, as to whether Lavinia had died a
natural death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we make the best of it,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;her
dying in that strangely sudden way was unusual; you
know that, Jules; quite unaccountable. It never <em>has</em>
been accounted for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur Jules, gazing on the gentle waves as they
rose and fell in the moonlight at the mouth of the
harbour, answered nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had so much to wish her away for, that man:
all the money would become Nancy&rsquo;s. And I&rsquo;m sure
there was secret enmity between them&mdash;on both sides.
Don&rsquo;t you see, Jules, how suspicious it all looks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moonbeams, illumining Monsieur Jules Carimon&rsquo;s
face, showed it to be very impassive, betraying
no indication that he as much as heard what his wife
was talking about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not forgotten, I can never forget, Jules, the
very singular Fate-reading, or whatever you may
please to call it, spoken by the Astrologer Talcke last
winter at Miss Bosanquet&rsquo;s soirée. You were not in
the room, you know, but I related it to you when we
arrived home. He certainly foretold Lavinia&rsquo;s death,
as I, recalling the words, look upon it now. He said
there was some element of evil in their house, threatening
and terrible; he repeated it more than once. <em>In
their house</em>, Jules, and that it would end in darkness;
which, as every one understood, meant death: not for
Mrs. Fennel; he took care to tell her that; but for
another. He said the cards were more fateful than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
he had ever seen them. That evil in the house was
Fennel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still Monsieur Jules offered no comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what could be the meaning of those dreams
Lavinia had about him, in which he always seemed to
be preparing to inflict upon her some fearful ill, and
she knew she never could and never would escape from
it?&rdquo; ran on Mary Carimon, her eager, suppressed
tones bearing a gruesome sound in the stillness of the
night. &ldquo;And what is the explanation of the fits of
terror which have shaken Fennel since the death,
fancying he sees Lavinia? Flore said to me this
morning that she is sure Lavinia is in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Glancing at her husband to see that he was at least
listening, but receiving no confirmation of it by word
or motion, Mary Carimon continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those dreams came to warn her, Jules. To warn
her to get out of the house while she could. And she
made arrangements to go, and in another day or two
would have been away in safety. But he was too
quick for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur Jules Carimon turned now to face his
wife. &ldquo;Mon amie, tais toi,&rdquo; said he with authority.
&ldquo;Such a topic is not convenable,&rdquo; he added, still in
French, though she had spoken in English. &ldquo;It is
dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Jules, I believe it <em>to have been so</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the same, and whether or no, it is not your
affair, Marie. Neither must you make it so. Believe
me, my wife, the only way to live peaceably ourselves
in the world is to let our neighbours&rsquo; sins alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>


<h3>XVII.</h3>

<p>Captain Edwin Fennel was certainly in no hurry
to return to Sainteville, for he did not come. Nancy,
ailing, weak, wretchedly uncomfortable, wrote letter
after letter to him, generally sending them over by
some friend or other who might be crossing, to be put
in a London letter-box, and so evade the foreign
postage. Once or twice she had written to Mrs. James,
telling of her lonely life and that she wanted Edwin
either to take her out of the dark and desolate house,
or else to come back to it himself. Captain Fennel
would answer now and again, promising to come&mdash;she
would be quite sure to see him on one of the first
boats if she looked out for their arrival. Nancy did
look, but she had not yet seen him. She was growing
visibly thinner and weaker. Sainteville said how ill
Mrs. Fennel was looking.</p>

<p>One evening at the end of July, when the London
steamer was due about ten o&rsquo;clock, Nancy went to
watch it in, as usual, Flore attending her. The port
was gay, crowded with promenaders. There had been
a concert at the Rooms, and the company was coming
home from it. Mrs. Fennel had not made one: latterly
she had felt no spirit for amusement. Several friends
met her; she did not tell them she had come down to
meet her husband, if haply he should be on the expected
boat; she had grown tired and half ashamed of
saying that; she let them think she was only out for
a walk that fine evening. There was a yellow glow
still in the sky where the sun had set; the north-west
was clear and bright with its opal light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The time went on; the port became deserted, excepting
a few passing stragglers. Ten o&rsquo;clock had
struck, eleven would soon strike. Flore and her
mistress, tired of pacing about, sat down on one of the
benches facing the harbour. One of two young men,
passing swiftly homewards from the pier, found himself
called to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charley! Charley Palliser!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charles turned, and recognized Mrs. Fennel.
Stepping across to her, he shook hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think can have become of the
boat?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It ought to have been in nearly
an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it will be here shortly,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The
boat often makes a slow passage when there&rsquo;s no
wind. What little wind we have had to-day has
been dead against it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve just said to madame,&rdquo; put in Flore, always
ready to take up the conversation. &ldquo;Mr. Charles
knows there&rsquo;s no fear it has gone down, though it
may be a bit late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly not,&rdquo; laughed Charley. &ldquo;Are you
waiting here for it, Mrs. Fennel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;s,&rdquo; she answered, but with hesitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as it&rsquo;s not even in sight yet, madame had
much better go home and not wait, for the air is getting
chilly,&rdquo; again spoke Flore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t see whether it&rsquo;s in sight or not,&rdquo; said
her mistress. &ldquo;It is dark out at sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I wait here with you, Mrs. Fennel?&rdquo; asked
Charley in his good nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no; no, thank you,&rdquo; she answered quickly.
&ldquo;If it does not come in soon, we shall go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>He wished them good-night, and went onwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is hoping the boat may bring that mysterious
brute, Fennel,&rdquo; remarked Charles to his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brute, you call him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is no better than one, to leave his sick wife
alone so long,&rdquo; responded Charles in hearty tones.
&ldquo;She has picked up an idea, I hear, that the house is
haunted, and shakes in her shoes in it from morning
till night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two watchers sat on, Flore grumbling. Not
for herself, but for her mistress. A sea-fog was
rising, and Flore thought madame might take cold.
Mrs. Fennel wrapped her light fleecy shawl closer
about her chest, and protested she was quite hot.
The shawl was well enough for a warm summer&rsquo;s
night, but not for a cold sea-fog. About half-past
eleven there suddenly loomed into view through the
mist the lights of the steamer, about to enter the
harbour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; exultingly cried Nancy, who had
been shivering inwardly for some time past, and doing
her best not to shiver outwardly for fear of Flore.
&ldquo;And now, Flore, you go home as quickly as you can
and make a fire in the salon to warm us. I&rsquo;m sure
he will need one&mdash;at sea in this cold fog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he is come,&rdquo; mentally returned Flore in her
derisive heart. She had no faith in the return of
Monsieur Fennel by any boat, a day or a night one.
But she needed no second prompting to hasten away;
was too glad to do it.</p>

<p>Poor Nancy waited on. The steamer came very
slowly up the port, or she fancied so; one must be
cautious in a fog; and it seemed to her a long time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
swinging round and settling itself into its place.
Then the passengers came on shore one by one, Nancy
standing close to look at them. There were only
about twenty in all, and Captain Fennel was not one
of them. With misty eyes and a rising in her throat
and spiritless footsteps, Nancy arrived at her home,
the Petite Maison Rouge. Flore had the fire burning
in the salon; but Nancy was too thoroughly chilled
for any salon fire to warm her.</p>

<p>The cold she caught that night stuck to her chest.
For some days afterwards she was very ill indeed.
Monsieur Dupuis attended her, and brought his son
once or twice, Monsieur Henri. Nancy got up again,
and was, so to say, herself once more; but she did not
get up her strength.</p>

<p>She would lie on the sofa in the salon those August
days, which were very hot ones, too languid to get off
it. Friends would call in to see her; Major and Mrs.
Smith, the Miss Bosanquets, the Lamberts, and so on.
Madame Carimon was often there. They would ask
her why she did not &ldquo;make an effort&rdquo; and sit up and
occupy herself with a book or a bit of work, or go out
a little; and Nancy&rsquo;s answer was nearly always the
same&mdash;she would do all that when the weather was
somewhat cooler. Charley Palliser was quite a constant
visitor. An English damsel, who was casting a
covetous eye to Charles, though she might have spared
herself the pains, took a fit of jealousy and said one
might think sick Nancy Fennel was his sweetheart,
going there so often. Charley rarely went empty-handed
either. Now it would be half-a-dozen
nectarines in their red-ripe loveliness, now some
choice peaches, then a bunch of hot-house grapes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
&ldquo;purple and gushing,&rdquo; and again an amusing novel
just out in England.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary, she is surely dying!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sad exclamation came from Stella Featherston.
She and Madame Carimon, going in to take tea at the
Petite Maison Rouge, had been sent by its mistress to
her chamber above to take off their bonnets. The
words had broken from Stella the moment they were
alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I fear it myself,&rdquo; replied Madame
Carimon. &ldquo;She certainly grows weaker instead of
stronger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does any doctor attend her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Dupuis; a man of long experience, kind
and clever. I was talking to him the other day, and
he as good as said his skill and care seemed to avail
nothing: were wasted on her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it consumption?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not. She caught a dreadful cold about a
month ago through being out in a night fog, thinly
clad; and there&rsquo;s no doubt it left mischief behind;
but it seems to me that she is wasting away with
inward fever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should get George to run over to see her, if I
were you, Mary,&rdquo; remarked Stella. &ldquo;French doctors
are very clever, I believe, especially as surgeons;
but for an uncertain case like this they don&rsquo;t come
up to the English. And George knows her constitution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went down to the salon, Mary Carimon
laughing a little at the remark. Stella Featherston
had not been long enough in France to part with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
native prejudices. The family with whom she lived
in Paris had journeyed to Sainteville for a month for
what they called &ldquo;les eaux,&rdquo; and Stella accompanied
them. They were in lodgings on the port.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fennel seemed more like her old self that
evening than she had been for some time past. The
unexpected presence of her companion of early days
changed the tone of her mind and raised her spirits.
Stella exerted all her mirth, talked of their doings in
the past, told of Buttermead&rsquo;s doings in the present.
Nancy was quite gay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you ever sing now, Stella?&rdquo; she suddenly
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; laughed Stella, &ldquo;unless I am quite
alone. Who would care to hear old ditties sung
without music?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should. Oh, Stella, sing me a few!&rdquo; urged
the invalid, her tone quite imploring. &ldquo;It would
bring the dear old days back to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stella Featherston had a most melodious voice, but
she did not play. It was not unusual in those days
for girls to sing without any accompaniment, as Stella
had for the most part done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you forgotten your Scotch songs, Stella?&rdquo;
asked Mary Carimon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I; I like them best of all,&rdquo; replied Miss
Featherston. And without more ado she broke into
&ldquo;Ye banks and braes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was followed by &ldquo;The Banks of Allan Water,&rdquo;
and others. Flore stole to the parlour-door, and
thought she had never heard so sweet a singer. Last
of all, Stella began a quaint song that was more of a
chant than anything else, low and subdued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Woe&rsquo;s me, for my heart is breakin&rsquo;,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I think on my brither sma&rsquo;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on my sister greetin&rsquo;,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When I cam&rsquo; from home awa&rsquo;.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And O, how my mither sobbit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As she took from me her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I left the door of our old house<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To come to this stranger land.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nae place like our ain home,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O, I would that I were there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There&rsquo;s nae home like our ain home<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To be met wi&rsquo; onywhere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And O, that I were back again<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To our farm and fields sae green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard the tongues of our ain folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And was what I hae been!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A feeling of despair ran through the whole words;
and the tears were running down Ann Fennel&rsquo;s hectic
cheeks as the melody died away in a plaintive silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what I shall never see again, Stella,&rdquo; she
murmured&mdash;&ldquo;the green fields of <em>our</em> home; or hear
the tongues of all the dear ones there. In my dreams,
sometimes, I am at Selby Court, light-hearted and
happy, as I was before I left it for this &lsquo;stranger
land.&rsquo; Woe&rsquo;s <em>me</em>, also, Stella!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And now I come into the story&mdash;I, Johnny Ludlow.
For what I have told of it hitherto has not been from
any personal knowledge of mine, but from diaries, and
from what Mary Carimon related to me, and from
Featherston. It may be regarded as singular that I
should have been, so to say, present at its ending, but
that I <em>was</em> there is as true as anything I ever wrote.
The story itself is true in all its chief facts; I have
already said that; and it is true that I saw the close
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>


<h3>XVIII.</h3>

<p>To say that George Featherston, Doctor-in-ordinary
at Buttermead, felt as if he were standing on his head
instead of his heels, would not in the least express his
mental condition as he stood in his surgery that
September afternoon and read a letter, just delivered,
from his sister, Madame Carimon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wants me to go to Sainteville to see Ann Preen;
thinks she will die if I refuse, for the French doctors
can do nothing for her!&rdquo; commented Featherston,
staring at the letter in intense perplexity, and then
looking off it to stare at me.</p>

<p>I wonder whether anything in this world happens
by chance? In the days and years that have gone by
since, I sometimes ask myself whether <em>that</em> did: that
I should be at that particular moment in Featherston&rsquo;s
surgery. Squire Todhetley was staying with Sir John
Whitney for partridge shooting. He had taken me
with him, Tod being in Gloucestershire; and on this
Friday afternoon I had run in to say &ldquo;How-d&rsquo;ye-do&rdquo;
to Featherston.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Sainteville!</em>&rdquo; repeated he, quite unable to collect
his senses. &ldquo;Why, I must cross the water to get
<em>there</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed. &ldquo;Did you think Sainteville would cross
to you, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless me! just listen to this,&rdquo; he went on, reading
parts of the letter aloud for my benefit. &ldquo;&lsquo;It is a
dreadful story, George; I dare not enter into details
here. But I may tell you this much: that she is
dying of fright as much as of fever&mdash;or whatever it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
may be that ails her physically. I am sure it is not
consumption, though some of the people here think it
is. It is fright and superstition. She lives in the
belief that the house is haunted: that Lavinia&rsquo;s ghost
walks in it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now what on earth can Mary mean by that?&rdquo;
demanded the doctor, looking off to ask me. &ldquo;Ann
Preen&rsquo;s wits must have left her. And Mary&rsquo;s too, to
repeat so nonsensical a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning to the next page of the letter, Featherston
read on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To see her dying by inches before my eyes, and
not make any attempt to, save her is what I cannot
reconcile myself to, George. I should have it on my
conscience afterwards. I think there is this one
chance for her: that you, who have attended her
before and must know her constitution, would see her
now. You might be able to suggest some remedy or
mode of treatment which would restore her. It might
even be that the sight of a home face, of her old home
doctor, would do for her what the strange doctors here
cannot do. No one knows better than you how
marvellously in illness the mind influences the body.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; broke off Featherston. &ldquo;But it
seems to me there must be something mysterious
about the sickness.&rdquo; He read on again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stella, who is here, was the first to suggest your
seeing her, but it was already exercising my thoughts.
Do come, George! the sooner the better. I and Jules
will be delighted to have you with us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Featherston slowly folded up the letter. &ldquo;What do
you think of all this, Johnny Ludlow? Curious, is it
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Very. Especially that hint about the house being
haunted by the dead-and-gone Miss Preen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never heard clearly what it was Lavinia
Preen died of,&rdquo; observed Featherston, leaving, doctor-like,
the supernatural for the practical. &ldquo;Except that
she was seized with some sort of illness one day and
died the next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s no reason why her ghost should walk.
Is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nancy&rsquo;s imagination,&rdquo; spoke Featherston slightingly.
&ldquo;She was always foolish and fanciful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall you go to Sainteville, Mr. Featherston?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave his head a slow, dubious shake, but did not
speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I wish such a chance were offered to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Featherston sat down on a high stool, which stood
before the physic shelves, to revolve the momentous
question. And by the time he took over it, he seemed
to find it a difficult task.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One hardly likes to refuse the request, put as Mary
writes it,&rdquo; remarked he presently. &ldquo;Yet I don&rsquo;t see
how I can go all the way over there; or how I could
leave my patients here. What a temper some of them
would be in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t die of it. It would be a rare
holiday for you. Set you up in health for a year to
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not had a holiday since that time at Pumpwater,&rdquo;
he rejoined dreamily; &ldquo;when I went over for
a day or two to see poor John Whitney. You
remember it, Johnny; you were there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, I remember it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that this is a question of a holiday for me or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
no holiday, and I wonder you should put it so,
Johnny Ludlow; it turns upon Ann Preen. Ann
Fennel, that&rsquo;s to say. If I thought I <em>could</em> do her
any good, and those French doctors can&rsquo;t, why, I
suppose I ought to make an effort to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure. Make one also to take me with
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say!&rdquo; laughed Featherston. &ldquo;What would
the Squire say to that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bluster a bit, and then see it was the very thing
for me, and ask what the cost would be. Mr. Featherston,
I shall be ready to start when you are. Please
let me go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course I said this half in jest. But it turned
out to be earnest. Whether Featherston feared he
might get lost if he crossed the sea alone, I can&rsquo;t say;
but he said I might put the question to the Squire if
I liked, and he would see him later and second it.</p>

<p>Featherston did another thing. He carried Mary
Carimon&rsquo;s letter that evening to Selby Court. Colonel
Selby was staying with his brother for a week&rsquo;s
shooting. Mr. Selby, a nervous valetudinarian, would
not have gone out with a gun if bribed to it, but he
invited his friends to do so. They had just finished
dinner when Featherston arrived; the two brothers,
and a short, dark, younger man with a rather keen
but good-natured face and kindly dark eyes. He was
introduced as Mr. David Preen, and turned out to be
a cousin, more or less removed, of all the Preens and
all the Selbys you have ever heard of, dead or living.</p>

<p>Featherston imparted his news to them, and showed
his sister&rsquo;s letter. It was pronounced to be a very
curious letter, and was read over more than once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Colonel Selby next told them what he knew and
what he thought of Edwin Fennel: how he had persistently
schemed to get the quarterly money of the
two ladies into his own covetous hands, and what a
shady sort of individual he was believed to be. Mr.
Selby, nervous at the best of times, let alone the
worst, became painfully impressed: he seemed to fear
poor Nancy was altogether in a hornet&rsquo;s nest, and gave
an impulsive opinion that some one of the family
ought to go over with Featherston to look into things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lavinia can&rsquo;t have been murdered, can she?&rdquo; cried
he, his thoughts altogether confused; &ldquo;murdered by
that man for her share of the money? Why else
should her ghost come back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make us laugh, Paul,&rdquo; said the colonel to
his brother. &ldquo;Ghosts are all moonshine. There are
no such things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can tell you that there <em>are</em>, William,&rdquo; returned
the elder. &ldquo;Though mercifully the power to see them
is accorded to very few mortals on earth. Can you
go with Mr. Featherston to look into this strange
business, William?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the colonel, &ldquo;I could not possibly
spare the time. Neither should I care to do it. Any
inquiry of that kind would be quite out of my line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; quietly spoke David Preen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do so, David,&rdquo; said Mr. Selby eagerly. &ldquo;It shall
cost you nothing, you know.&rdquo; By which little speech,
Featherston gathered that Mr. David Preen was not
more overdone with riches than were many of the
other Preens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look into it well, David. See the doctor who
attended Lavinia; see all and every one able to throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
any light upon her death,&rdquo; urged Mr. Selby. &ldquo;As to
Ann, she was lamentably, foolishly blamable to marry
as she did, but she must not be left at the villain&rsquo;s
mercy now things have come to this pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which Mr. David Preen nodded an emphatic
assent.</p>

<p>The Squire gave in at last. Not to my pleading&mdash;he
accused me of having lost my head only to think
of it&mdash;but to Featherston. And when the following
week was wearing away, the exigencies of Featherston&rsquo;s
patients not releasing him sooner, we started
for Sainteville; he, I, and David Preen. Getting in
at ten at night after a boisterous passage, Featherston
took up his quarters at Monsieur Carimon&rsquo;s, we ours
at the Hôtel des Princes.</p>

<p>She looked very ill. Ill and changed. I had seen
Ann Preen at Buttermead when she lived there, but
the Ann Preen (or Fennel) I saw now was not much
like her. The once bright face was drawn and fallen
in, and very nearly as long and grey as Featherston&rsquo;s.
Apart from that, a timid, shrinking look sat upon it,
as though she feared some terror lay very near to her.</p>

<p>The sick have to be studied, especially when suffering
from whims and fancies. So they invented a
little fable to Mrs. Fennel&mdash;that Featherston and
David Preen were taking an excursion together for
their recreation, and the doctor had extended it as far
as Sainteville to see his sister Mary; never allowing
her to think that it was to see <em>her</em>. I was with them,
but I went for nobody&mdash;and in truth that&rsquo;s all I was
in the matter.</p>

<p>It was the forenoon of the day after we arrived.
David Preen had gone in first, her kinsman and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
distant cousin, to the Petite Maison Rouge, paving
the way, as it were, for Featherston. We went in
presently. Mrs. Fennel sat in a large armchair by
the salon fire, wrapped in a grey shawl; she was
always cold now, she told us; David Preen sat on
the sofa opposite, talking pleasantly of home news.
Featherston joined him on the sofa, and I sat down
near the table.</p>

<p>Oh, she was glad to see us! Glad to see us all.
Ours were home faces, you see. She held my hands
in hers, and the tears ran down her face, betraying
her state of weakness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not been very well of late, Mary tells
me,&rdquo; Featherston said to her in a break of the conversation.
&ldquo;What has been the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;it came on from a bad cold I caught,&rdquo; she
answered with some hesitation. &ldquo;And there was all
the trouble about Lavinia&rsquo;s death. I could not get
over the grief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I must say you don&rsquo;t look very robust,&rdquo;
returned Featherston, in a half-joking tone. &ldquo;I think
I had better take you in hand whilst I am here, and
set you up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think you can set me up; I do not
suppose any one can,&rdquo; she replied, shaking back her
curls, which fell on each side of her face in ringlets,
as of old.</p>

<p>Featherston smiled cheerily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Some of my patients say the same when I am first
called in to them; but they change their tone after
I have brought back their roses. So will you; never
fear. I&rsquo;ll come in this afternoon and have a professional
chat with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>That settled, they went on with Buttermead again;
David Preen giving scraps and revelations of the Preen
and Selby families; Featherston telling choice items
of the rural public in general. Mrs. Fennel&rsquo;s spirits
went up to animation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall you be able to do anything for her, sir?&rdquo;
I asked the doctor as we came away and went through
the entry to the Place Ronde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; he answered gravely. &ldquo;She has a
look on her face that I do not like to see there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betrayed into confidence, I suppose, by the presence
of the old friend of her girlhood, Ann Fennel related
everything to Mr. Featherston that afternoon, as they
sat on the sofa side by side, her hand occasionally
held soothingly in his own. He assured her plainly
that what she was chiefly suffering from was a disorder
of the nerves, and that she must state to him
explicitly the circumstances which brought it on before
he could decide how to treat her for it.</p>

<p>Nancy obeyed him. She yearned to get well,
though a latent impression lay within her that she
should not do so. She told him the particulars of
Lavinia&rsquo;s unexpected death just when on the point of
leaving Sainteville; and she went on to declare,
glancing over her shoulders with frightened eyes, that
she (Lavinia) had several times since then appeared
in the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Lavinia die of?&rdquo; inquired the doctor at
this juncture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could not tell,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Fennel. &ldquo;It
puzzled us. At first Monsieur Dupuis thought it must
be inflammation brought on by a chill; but Monsieur
Podevin quite put that opinion aside, saying it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
nothing of the sort. He is a younger and more
energetic practitioner than Monsieur Dupuis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it never suggested that she might, in one
way or another, have taken something which poisoned
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, it was; I believe Monsieur Dupuis did
think so&mdash;I am sure Monsieur Podevin did. But it
was impossible it could have been the case, you see,
because Lavinia touched nothing either of the days
that we did not also partake of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ought to have been an examination after
death. You objected to that, I fancy,&rdquo; continued
Featherston, who had talked a little with Madame
Carimon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True&mdash;I did; and I have been sorry for it since,&rdquo;
sighed Ann Fennel. &ldquo;It was through what my
husband said to me that I objected. Edwin thought
it would be distasteful to me. He did not like the
idea of it either. Being dead, he held that she should
be left in reverence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Featherston coughed. She was evidently innocent
as any lamb of suspicion against <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; went on Mr. Featherston, &ldquo;just tell me
what you mean by saying you see your sister about
the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do see her,&rdquo; said Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! You don&rsquo;t. It is all fancy. When the
nerves are unstrung, as yours are, they play us all
sorts of tricks. Why, I knew a man once who took
up a notion that he walked upon his head, and he
came to me to be cured!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is seeing Lavinia&rsquo;s apparition, and the
constant fear of seeing it which lies upon me, that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
brought on this nervousness,&rdquo; pleaded Nancy. &ldquo;It is
to my husband, when he is here, that she chiefly
appears; nothing but that is keeping him away. I
have seen her only three or four times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke quietly and simply, evidently grounded
in the belief. Mr. Featherston wondered how he was
to deal with this: and perhaps he was not himself so
much of a sceptic in the supernatural as he thought
fit to pretend. Nancy continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was to my husband she appeared first. Exactly
a week after her death. No; a week after the evening
she was first taken ill. He was coming upstairs to
bed&mdash;I had gone on&mdash;when he suddenly fancied that
some one was following him, though only he and I
were in the house. Turning quickly round, he saw
Lavinia. That was the first time; and I assure you
I thought he would have died of it. Never before
had I witnessed such mortal terror in man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you he had seen her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; never. I could not imagine what brought
on these curious attacks of fright, for he had others.
He put it upon his health. It was only when I saw
Lavinia myself after he went to England that I knew.
I knew then what it must have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Featherston was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She always appears in the same dress,&rdquo; continued
Nancy; &ldquo;a silver-grey silk that she wore at church
that Sunday. It was the last gown she ever put on:
we took it off her when she was first seized with the
pain. And in her face there is always a sad, beseeching
aspect, as if she wanted something and were
imploring us to get it for her. <em>Indeed</em> we see her,
Mr. Featherston.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he said, perceiving it was not from this
quarter that light could be thrown on the suspicious
darkness of the past, &ldquo;let us talk of yourself. You
are to obey my orders in all respects, Mistress Nancy.
We will soon have you flourishing again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brave words. Perhaps the doctor half believed in
them himself. But he and they received a check all
too soon.</p>

<p>That same evening, after David Preen had left&mdash;for
he went in to spend an hour at the little red house
to gossip about the folks at home&mdash;Nancy was taken
with a fit of shivering. Flore hastily mixed her a
glass of hot wine-and-water, and then went upstairs
to light a fire in the bedroom, thinking her mistress
would be the better for it. Nancy, who could hear
Flore moving about overhead, suddenly remembered
something that she wanted brought down. Rising
from her chair, she went to the door of the salon,
intending to call out. A sort of side light, dim and
indistinct, fell upon her as she stood in the recess at
the foot of the stairs from the lamp in the salon and
from the stove in the kitchen, for both doors were
open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flore,&rdquo; she was beginning, &ldquo;will you bring down
my&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And there Ann Fennel&rsquo;s words ended. With a wild
cry, which reached the ears of Flore and nearly startled
her into fits, Mrs. Fennel collapsed. The servant came
dashing downstairs, expecting to hear that the ghost
had appeared again.</p>

<p>It was not that. Her mistress was looking wild
and puzzled; and when she recovered herself sufficiently
to speak, declared that she had been startled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
by some animal. Either a cat or a rabbit, she could
not tell which, the glimpse she caught of it was so
brief and slight; it had run against her legs as she
was calling out.</p>

<p>Flore did not know what to make of this. She
looked about, but neither cat nor rabbit was to be seen;
and she told her mistress it could have been nothing
but fancy. Mrs. Fennel thought she knew better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I felt it and saw it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It came
right against me and ran over my feet. It seemed to
be making for the passage, as if it wanted to get out
by the front-door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were gathered together in the salon of the Petite
Maison Rouge the following morning, partly by accident.
Ann Fennel, exceedingly weak and nervous,
lay in bed. Featherston and Monsieur Dupuis were
both upstairs. She put down her illness to the fright,
which she talked of to them freely. They did not
assure her it was only &ldquo;nerves&rdquo;&mdash;to what purpose? I
waited in the salon with David Preen, and just as the
doctors came down Madame Carimon came in.</p>

<p>David Preen seized upon the opportunity. Fearing
that one so favourable might not again occur, unless
formally planned, he opened the ball. Drawing his
chair to the table, next to that of Madame Carimon,
the two doctors sitting opposite, David Preen avowed,
with straightforward candour, that he, with some
other relatives, held a sort of doubt as to whether it
might not have been something Miss Lavinia Preen
took which caused her death; and he begged Monsieur
Dupuis to say if any such doubt had crossed his own
mind at the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The fair-faced little médecin shook his head at this
appeal, as much as to say he thought that the subject
was a puzzling one. Naturally the doubt had crossed
him, and very strongly, he answered; but the difficulty
in assuming that view of the matter lay in her having
partaken solely of the food which the rest of the
household had partaken of; that and nothing else.
His confrère, Monsieur Podevin, held a very conclusive
opinion&mdash;that she had died of poison.</p>

<p>David Preen drew towards him a writing-case which
lay on the table, took a sheet of paper from it, and a
pencil from his pocket. &ldquo;Let us go over the facts
quietly,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it may be we shall arrive at some
decision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they went over the facts, the chief speakers
being Madame Carimon and Flore, who was called in.
David Preen dotted down from time to time something
which I suppose particularly impressed him.</p>

<p>Miss Preen was in perfectly good health up to that
Sunday&mdash;the first after Easter. On the following
Tuesday she was about to quit Sainteville for
Boulogne, her home at the Petite Maison Rouge
having become intolerable to her through the residence
in it of Captain Fennel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me if I state here something which is not
positively in the line of facts; rather, perhaps, in that
of imagination,&rdquo; said Madame Carimon, looking up.
&ldquo;Lavinia had gradually acquired a most painful dread
of Captain Fennel. She had dreams which she could
only believe came to warn her against him, in which
he appeared to be threatening her with some evil that
she could not escape from. Once or twice&mdash;and this
I cannot in any way account for&mdash;she saw him in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
house when he was not in it, not even at Sainteville&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! saw his apparition?&rdquo; cried Featherston.
&ldquo;When the man was living! Come, come, Mary, that
is going too far!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quelle drôle d&rsquo;idée!&rdquo; exclaimed the little doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He appeared to her twice, she told me,&rdquo; continued
Mary Carimon. &ldquo;She had been spending the evening
out each time; had come into the house, this house,
closing the street-door behind her. When she lighted
a candle at the slab, she saw him standing just inside
the door, gazing at her with the same dreadful aspect
that she saw afterwards in her dreams. You may
laugh, George; Monsieur Dupuis, I think you are
already laughing; but I fully believe that she saw
what she said she did, and dreamt what she did
dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it could not have been the man&rsquo;s apparition
when he was not dead; and it could not have been
the man himself when he was not at Sainteville,&rdquo; contended
Featherston.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I believe that it all meant one of those
mysterious warnings which are vouchsafed us from
our spiritual guardians in the unseen world,&rdquo; added
Madame Carimon, independently pursuing her argument.
&ldquo;And that it came to Lavinia to warn her to
escape from this evil house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she did not do it,&rdquo; remarked David Preen.
&ldquo;She was not quick enough. Well, let us go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Lavinia came out of church, Charles Palliser
ran after her to ask her to go home to dine with him
and his aunt,&rdquo; resumed Madame Carimon. &ldquo;If she
had only accepted it! The dinner here was a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
simple one, and they all partook of it, including
Flore&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it was Flore who cooked and served it?&rdquo;
interrupted David Preen, looking at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mais oui, monsieur. The tart excepted; that was
frangipane, and did come from the pastrycook,&rdquo; added
Flore, plunging into English. &ldquo;Then I had my own
dinner, and I had of every dish; and I drank of the
wine. Miss Lavinia would give me a glass of wine
on the Sunday, and she poured it out for me herself
that day from the bottle of Bordeaux on their
own table. Nothing was the matter with any of all
that. The one thing I did not have of was the
liqueur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What liqueur was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was chartreuse, I believe,&rdquo; said Flore. &ldquo;While
I was busy removing the dinner articles from the
salon, monsieur was busy at his cupboard outside
there, where he kept his bottles. He came into the
kitchen just as I had sat down to eat, and asked me
for three liqueur glasses, which I gave to him on a
plate. I heard him pour the liqueur into them, and
he carried them to the ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. David Preen wrote something down here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After that the captain went out to walk, saying
he would see the English boat enter; and when I had
finished washing up I carried the tea-tray to the
salon-table and went home. Miss Lavinia was quite
well then; she sat in her belle robe of grey silk talking
with her sister. Then, when I was giving my
boy Dion his collation, a tartine and a cooked apple, I
was fetched back here, and found the poor lady fighting
with pain for her life.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you wash those liqueur glasses?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Featherston.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But yes, sir. I had taken them away when I
carried in the tea-things, and washed them at once,
and put them on the shelf in their places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; observed Monsieur Dupuis, &ldquo;the ill-fated
lady appears to have taken nothing that the others
did not take also. I applied my remedies when I was
called to her, and the following day she had, as I
believed, recovered from the attack; nothing but the
exhaustion left by the agony was remaining. But
that night she was again seized, and I was again
fetched to her. The attack was even more violent
than the first one. I made a request for another
doctor, and Monsieur Podevin was brought. He at
once set aside my suggestion of inflammation from a
chill, and said it looked to him more like a case of
poison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had had nothing but slops all day, messieurs,
which I made and carried to her,&rdquo; put in Flore;
&ldquo;and when I left, at night, she was, as Monsieur le
Médecin put it, &lsquo;all well to look at.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flore did not make the arrowroot which she took
later,&rdquo; said Mary Carimon, taking up the narrative.
&ldquo;When Lavinia went up to bed, towards nine o&rsquo;clock,
Mrs. Fennel made her a cup of arrowroot in the
kitchen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a cup for herself at the same time, as I was
informed, madame,&rdquo; spoke the little doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I know that, Monsieur Dupuis. Mrs.
Fennel brought her sister&rsquo;s arrowroot, when it was
ready, into this room, asking her husband whether
she might venture to put a little brandy into it. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
sent her to ask the question of Lavinia, bidding her
leave the arrowroot on the table here. She came
down for it, saying Lavinia declined the brandy,
carried it up to her and saw her take it. Mrs. Fennel
wished her good-night and came down for her own
portion, which she had left in the kitchen. Before
eleven o&rsquo;clock, when they were going to bed, cries
were heard in Lavinia&rsquo;s room; she was seized with
the second attack, and&mdash;and died in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This second attack was so violent, so unmanageable,&rdquo;
said Monsieur Dupuis, as Mary Carimon&rsquo;s voice
faltered into silence, &ldquo;that I feel convinced I could
not have saved her had I been present when it came
on. I hear that Captain Fennel says he rang several
times at my door before he could arouse me. Such
was not the case. I am a very light sleeper, waking,
from habit, at the slightest sound. But in this case I
had not had time to fall asleep when I fancied I heard
the bell sound very faintly. I thought I must be
mistaken, as the bell is a loud bell, and rings easily;
and people who ring me up at night generally ring
pretty sharply. I lay listening, and some time afterwards,
not immediately, it did ring. I opened my
window, saw Captain Fennel outside, and was dressed
and with him in two minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds as if he did not want you to go to
her too quickly, monsieur,&rdquo; observed Mr. Featherston,
which went, as the French have it, without saying.
&ldquo;And I have heard of another suspicious fact: that
he put his wife up to stop the medical examination
after death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It amounts to this,&rdquo; spoke David Preen, &ldquo;according
to our judgment, if anything wrong was administered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to her, it was given in the glass of liqueur on the
Sunday afternoon, and in the cup of arrowroot on the
Monday evening. They were the only things affording
an opportunity of being tampered with; and in
each case the pain came on about two hours afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grave suspicion, as I am sure they all felt it to be.
But not enough, as Featherston remarked, to accuse a
man of murder. There was no proof to be brought
forward, especially now that months had elapsed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What became of the cup which had contained the
arrowroot?&rdquo; inquired David Preen, looking at Flore.
&ldquo;Was it left in the bedroom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That cup, sir, I found in a bowl of water in the
kitchen, and also the other one which had been used.
The two were together in the wooden bowl. I supposed
Madame Fennel had put them there; but she
said she had not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed David Preen, drawing a deep
breath.</p>

<p>He had come over to look into this suspicious
matter; but, as it seemed, nothing could be done. To
stir in it, and fail, would be worse than letting it
alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look you,&rdquo; said David Preen, as he put up his
note-book. &ldquo;If it be true that Lavinia cannot rest
now she&rsquo;s dead, but shows herself here in the house,
I regard it as a pretty sure proof that she was sent
out of the world unjustly. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you hold the belief that spirits revisit the
earth, monsieur,&rdquo; interrupted Monsieur Dupuis, &ldquo;and
that revenants are to be seen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, sir,&rdquo; replied David. &ldquo;We Preens see them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
But I cannot stir in this matter, I was about to say,
and the man must be left to his conscience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the conference broke up.</p>

<p>The thing which lay chiefly on hand now was to
try to bring health back to Ann Fennel. It was
thought well to take her out of the house for a short
time, as she had such fancies about it; so Featherston
gave up his room at Madame Carimon&rsquo;s, and Ann was
invited to move into it, whilst he joined us at the
hotel. I thought her very ill, as we all did. But
after her removal there, she recovered her spirits
wonderfully, and went out for short walks and
laughed and chatted: and when Featherston and
David Preen took the boat back to return home, she
went to the port to see them steam off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it be all right with her?&rdquo; was the last
question Mary Carimon whispered to her brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid <em>not</em>,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;A little time will
show one way or the other. Depends somewhat, perhaps,
upon how that husband of hers allows things to
go on. I have done what I can, Mary; I could not
do more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Does the reader notice that I did not include myself
in those who steamed off? For I did not go. Good,
genial little Jules Carimon, who was pleased to say
he had always liked me much at school, invited me to
make a stay at his house, if I did not mind putting
up with a small bedroom in the mansarde. I did not
mind it at all; it was large enough for me. Nancy
was delighted. We had quite a gay time of it; and
I made the acquaintance of Major and Mrs. Smith,
the Misses Bosanquet and Charley Palliser, who was
shortly to quit Sainteville. Charley&rsquo;s impression of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Mrs. Fennel was that she would quit it before he did,
but in a different manner.</p>

<p>One fine afternoon, when we were coming off the
pier, Nancy was walking between me and Mary
Carimon, for she needed the support of two arms if
she went far&mdash;yes, she was as weak as that&mdash;some
one called out that the London boat was coming in.
Turning round, we saw her gliding smoothly up the
harbour. No one in these Anglo-French towns
willingly misses <em>that</em> sight, and we drew up on the
quay to watch the passengers land. There were only
eight or ten of them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nancy gave a great cry, which bore a
sound both of fear and of gladness&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s
Edwin!&rdquo;&mdash;and the next moment began to shake her
pocket-handkerchief frantically.</p>

<p>A thin, grey, weasel of a man, whose face I did not
like, came stalking up the ladder. Yes, it was the
ex-captain, Edwin Fennel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has not come for her sake; he has come to
grab the quarter&rsquo;s money,&rdquo; spoke Mary, quite savagely,
in my ear. No doubt. It would be due the end of
September, which was at hand.</p>

<p>The captain was elaborately polite; quite effusive
in his greeting to us. Nancy left us and took his
arm. At the turning where we had to branch off to
the Rue Pomme Cuite, she halted to say good-bye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are coming back to us, are you not?&rdquo;
cried Madame Carimon to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I could not let Edwin go home alone,&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s there but Flore, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she went back there and then to the Petite
Maison Rouge, and never came out of it again. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
think he was kind to her, that man. He had sometimes
a scared look upon his face, and I guessed he
had been seeing sights. The man would have given
his head to be off again; to remain in that haunted
house must have been to him a most intolerable
penance; but he had some regard (policy dictating it)
for public opinion, and could not well run away from
his wife in her failing health.</p>

<p>It was curious how quickly Nancy declined. From
the very afternoon she entered the house it seemed to
begin. He had grabbed the money, as Mary Carimon
called it, and brought her nice and nourishing things;
but nothing availed. And a fine way he must have
been in, to see that; for with his wife&rsquo;s death the
money would go away from him for evermore.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupuis, sometimes Monsieur Henry Dupuis,
saw her daily; and Captain Fennel hastily called in
another doctor who had the reputation of being the
best in the town, next to Monsieur Podevin; one
Monsieur Lamirand. Mary Carimon spent half her
time there; I went in most days. It could not be
said that she had any special complaint, but she was
too weak to live.</p>

<p>In less than three weeks it was all over. The end,
when it came, was quite sudden. For a day or two
she had seemed so much better that we told her she
had taken a turn at last. On the Thursday evening,
quite late&mdash;it was between eight and nine o&rsquo;clock&mdash;Madame
Carimon asked me to run there with some
jelly which she had made, and which was only then
ready. When I arrived, Flore said she was sure her
mistress would like me to go up to her room; she was
alone, monsieur having stepped out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Nancy, wrapped in a warm dressing-gown, sat by
the fire in an easy-chair and a great shawl. Her fair
curls were all put back under a small lace cap, which
was tied at the chin with grey ribbon; her pretty blue
eyes were bright. I told her what I had come for,
and took the chair in front of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look so well this evening, Nancy,&rdquo; I said
heartily&mdash;for I had learnt to call her so at Madame
Carimon&rsquo;s, as they did. &ldquo;We shall have you getting
well now all one way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the spurt of the candle before going out,&rdquo; she
quietly answered. &ldquo;I have not the least pain left
anywhere&mdash;but it is only that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should not say or think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I know it; I cannot mistake my own feelings.
Fancy any one, reduced as I am, getting well
again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am a bad one to keep up &ldquo;make-believes.&rdquo; Truth
to say, I felt as sure of it as she did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it will not be very long first. Johnny,&rdquo; she
went on, in a half-whisper, &ldquo;I saw Lavinia to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at her, but made no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never seen her since I came back here.
Edwin has, though; I am sure of it. This afternoon
at dusk I woke up out of a doze, for getting up to sit
here quite exhausts me, and I was moving forward to
touch the hand-bell on the table there, to let Flore
know I was ready for my tea, when I saw Lavinia.
She was standing over there, just in the firelight. I
thought she seemed to be holding out her hand to me,
as if inviting me to go to her, and on her face there
was the sweetest smile of welcome; sweeter than could
be seen on any face in life. All the sad, mournful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
beseeching look had left it. She stood there for about
a minute, and then vanished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you very much frightened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had not a thought of fear, Johnny. It was the
contrary. She looked radiantly happy; and it somehow
imparted happiness to me. I think&mdash;I think,&rdquo;
added Nancy impressively, though with some hesitation,
&ldquo;that she came to let me know I am going to
her. I believe I have seen her for the last time. The
house has, also, I fancy; she and I will shortly go out
of it together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What could I answer to that?</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so it is over at last,&rdquo; she murmured, more to
herself than to me. &ldquo;Very nearly over. The distress
and the doubt, the terror and the pain. <em>I</em> brought it
all on; you know that, Johnny Ludlow. I feel sure
now that she has pardoned me. I humbly hope that
God has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She caught up her breath with a long-drawn sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will give my dear love to all the old
friends in England, Johnny, beginning with Mr.
Featherston; he has been very kind to me; you will
see them again, but I shall not. Not in this life. But
we shall be together in the Life which has no ending.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At twelve o&rsquo;clock that night Nancy Fennel died.
At least, it was as near twelve as could be told. Just
after that hour Flore went into the room, preparatory
to sitting up with her, and found her dead&mdash;just
expired, apparently&mdash;with a sweet smile on her face,
and one hand stretched out as if in greeting. Perhaps
Lavinia had come to greet her.</p>

<p>We followed her to the grave on Saturday. Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Fennel walked next the coffin&mdash;and I wondered how
he liked it. I was close behind him with Monsieur
Carimon. Charley Palliser came next with little
Monsieur le Docteur Dupuis and Monsieur Gustave
Sauvage. And we left Nancy in the cemetery, side
by side with her sister.</p>

<p>Captain Edwin Fennel disappeared. On the Sunday,
when we English were looking for him in church, he
did not come&mdash;his grief not allowing him, said some
of the ladies. But an English clerk in the broker&rsquo;s
office, hearing this, told another tale. Fennel had gone
off by the boat which left the port for London the
previous night at midnight.</p>

<p>And he did not come back again. He had left
sundry debts behind him, including that owing to
Madame Veuve Sauvage. Monsieur Carimon, later,
undertook the payment of these at the request of
Colonel Selby. It was understood that Captain Edwin
Fennel had emigrated to South America. If he had
any conscience at all, it was to be hoped he carried it
with him. He did not carry the money. The poor
little income which he had schemed for, and perhaps
worse, went back to the Selbys.</p>

<p>And that is the story. It is a curious history, and
painful in more ways than one. But I repeat that it
is true.</p>

<h2>WATCHING ON ST. MARK&rsquo;S EVE.</h2>


<p>Easter-Day that year was nearly as late as it could
be&mdash;the twenty-third of April. That brought St.
Mark&rsquo;s Day (the twenty-fifth) on the Tuesday; and
Easter Monday was St. Mark&rsquo;s Eve.</p>

<p>There is a superstitious belief in our county, and in
some others&mdash;more thought of in our old grannies&rsquo;
days than in these&mdash;that if you go to the churchyard
on St. Mark&rsquo;s Eve and watch the gate, the shadows,
or phantoms, of those fated to die that year, and
destined there to be buried, will be seen to enter it.</p>

<p>Easter Monday is a great holiday with us; the
greatest in all the year. Christmas-Day and Good
Friday are looked upon more in a religious light; but
on Easter Monday servants and labourers think themselves
at liberty to take their swing. The first day of
the wake is nothing to it.</p>

<p>Now Squire Todhetley gave in to these holidays:
they did not come often, he said. Our servants in the
country are not a bit like yours in town; yours want
a day&rsquo;s holiday once a month, oftener sometimes, and
strike if they don&rsquo;t get it; ours have one or two in a
year. On Easter Monday the work was got over by
mid-day; there was no cooking, and the household
could roam abroad at will. No ill had ever come of
it; none would have come of it this time, but for St.
Mark&rsquo;s Eve falling on the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Tod and I got home from school on the Thursday.
It was a despicable old school, taking no heed of
Passion Week. Other fellows from other schools could
have a fortnight at Easter; we but a week. Tod
entered on a remonstrance with the pater this time;
he had been planning it as we drove home, and
thought he&rsquo;d put it in a strongish point of view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is sinful, you know, sir; awfully so. Passion
Week <em>is</em> Passion Week. We have no right to pass it
at school at our desks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Joe, I don&rsquo;t quite see that,&rdquo; returned the
pater, twisting his lip. &ldquo;Discipline and lessons are
more in accordance with the season of Passion Week
than kicking up your heels at large in all sorts of mischief;
and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d be at, you know, if you
were at home. What&rsquo;s the matter with Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has been ill for three days, with a cold or
something,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;Tell it for yourself, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had no more to tell than that. For three or four
days I had felt ill, feverish; yesterday (Wednesday)
had done no lessons. Mrs. Todhetley thought it was
an attack of influenza. She sent me to bed, and called
in the doctor, Mr. Duffham.</p>

<p>I was better the next day&mdash;Good Friday. Old Duff&mdash;as
Tod and I called him for short&mdash;came in while
they were at church, and said I might get up. It
was slow work, I told him, lying in bed for one&rsquo;s
holidays. He was a wiry little man, with black hair;
good in the main, but pompous, and always carried
a gold-headed cane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to go out, you know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must
promise that, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I promised readily. I only wanted to be downstairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
with the rest. They returned home from
church, saying they had promised to go over and take
tea with the Sterlings; Mrs. Todhetley looked grave
at seeing me, and thought the doctor was wrong. At
which I put on a gay air, like a fellow suddenly
cured.</p>

<p>But I could not eat any dinner. They had salt fish
and cold boiled beef at two o&rsquo;clock&mdash;our usual way
of fasting on Good Friday. Not a morsel could I
swallow, and Hannah brought me some mutton-broth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mind our leaving you, Johnny?&rdquo; Mrs.
Todhetley said to me in her kind way&mdash;which Tod
never believed in. &ldquo;If you do&mdash;if you think you
shall feel lonely, I&rsquo;ll stay at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I answered that I should feel very jolly, not lonely
at all; and so they started, going over in the large
carriage, drawn by Bob and Blister. Mr. and Mrs.
Todhetley, with Lena, in front, Tod and Hugh behind.
Standing at the window to watch the start, I saw
Roger Monk looking on from the side of the house.</p>

<p>He was a small, white-faced chap of twenty or so,
with a queer look in his eyes, and black sprouting
whiskers. Looking full at the eyes, when you could
get the chance, which was not very often, for they
rarely looked at you, there was nothing wrong to be
seen with them, and yet they gave a sinister cast to
the face. Perhaps it was that they were too near
together. Roger Monk was not one of our regular
men; for the matter of that, he was above the condition;
but was temporarily filling the head-gardener&rsquo;s
place, who was ill with rheumatism. Seeing me, he
walked up to the window, and I opened it to speak to
him. &ldquo;Are you here still, Monk?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And likely to be, Mr. Ludlow, if it depends upon
Jenkins&rsquo;s coming on again,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Fine
cattle, those that the governor has just driven off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He meant Bob and Blister, and they were fine; but
I did not like the tone, or the word &ldquo;governor,&rdquo; as
applied to Mr. Todhetley. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep the window
up,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, sir; shut it. As for me, I must be
about my work. There&rsquo;s enough to do with the
gardens, one way or another; and the responsibility
lies on my shoulders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not work to-day, Monk. Squire Todhetley
never allows it on Good Friday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed pleasantly; as much as to say, what
Squire Todhetley allowed, or did not allow, was no
concern of his; and went briskly away across the
lawn. And not once, during the short interview, had
his eyes met mine.</p>

<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it dull that afternoon! I took old Duffham&rsquo;s
physic, and drank the tea Hannah brought me,
and was hot, and restless, and sick. Never a soul to
talk to; never a book to read&mdash;my eyes and head
ached too much for that; never a voice to be heard.
Most of the servants were out; all of them, for what I
knew, except Hannah; and I was fit to die of weariness.
At dusk I went up to the nursery. Hannah
was not there. The fire was raked&mdash;if you understand
what that means, though it is generally applied
only to kitchen fires in our county&mdash;which proved
that she was off somewhere on a prolonged expedition.
Even old Hannah&rsquo;s absence was a disappointment. I
threw myself down on the faded sofa at the far end of
the room, and, I suppose, went to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>For when I became alive again to outward things,
Hannah was seated in one chair at the fire, cracking
up the coal; Molly, the cook with the sharp tongue
and red-brown eyes, in another. It was dark and
late; my head ached awfully, and I wished them and
their clatter somewhere. They were talking of St.
Mark&rsquo;s Eve, and its popular superstition. Molly was
telling a tale of the past, the beginning of which I had
not heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; exclaimed Hannah; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
believe that the shadows come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did ye ever watch for &rsquo;em, woman?&rdquo; asked Molly,
who had been born in the North.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; acknowledged Hannah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how can ye speak of what ye don&rsquo;t know?
It is as true as that you and me be a-sitting here.
Two foolish, sickly girls they was, both of &rsquo;em sweet
upon the same young man. Leastways, he was sweet
upon both of them, the deceiver, which comes to the
same thing. My sister Becky was five-and-twenty
that same year; she had a constant pain and a cough,
which some said was windpipe and some said was
liver. The other was Mary Clarkson, who was subject
to swimmings in the head and frightful dartings.
Any way, they&rsquo;d got no health to brag on, either of
&rsquo;em, and they were just eat up with jealousy, the one
of the other. Tom Town, he knew this; and he
played &rsquo;em off again&rsquo; each other nicely, little thinking
what his own punishment was to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hannah gently put the poker inside the bars to
raise the coal, and some more light came out. Molly
went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Hannah, you mustn&rsquo;t think bad of them two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
young women. They did not wish one another dead&mdash;far
from it; but each thought the other couldn&rsquo;t live.
In natural course, if the one went off, poor thing, Tom
Town, he would be left undivided for the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was Tom Town handsome?&rdquo; interrupted Hannah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, middling for that. He was under-sized, not
up to their shoulders, with big bushy red whiskers;
but he had a taking way with him. He was in a
shop for himself, and doing well, so that more young
women nor the two I am telling of would have said
Yes to his asking. Becky, she thought Mary Clarkson
couldn&rsquo;t live the year out; Mary, she told a friend
that she was sure Becky wouldn&rsquo;t. And what should
they do but go to watch the graveyard on St. Mark&rsquo;s
Eve, to see the other&rsquo;s shadow pass!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but they met there. Awk&rsquo;ard, wasn&rsquo;t it?
Calling up their wits, each of &rsquo;em, they pretended to
have come out promiskous, just on the spree, not
expecting to see nobody&rsquo;s shadow in particular. As
they <em>had</em> come, they stopped; standing back again&rsquo;
the hedge near the graveyard, holding on to each
other&rsquo;s arms for company, and making belief not to
be scared. Hannah, woman, I don&rsquo;t care to tell this.
I&rsquo;ve never told it many times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly&rsquo;s face had a hard, solemn look, in the fire&rsquo;s
blaze, and Hannah suddenly drew her chair close to
her. I could have laughed out loud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as the clock struck&mdash;ten, I think it was,&rdquo;
went on Molly, in a half-whisper, &ldquo;there was a faint
rustle heard, like a flutter in the air, and somebody
came along the road. At first the women&rsquo;s eyes were
dazed, and they didn&rsquo;t see distinct, but as the gate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
opened to let him in, he turned his face, and they saw
it was Tom Town. Both the girls thought it was
<em>himself</em>, Hannah; and they held their breath and kept
quite still, hoping he&rsquo;d not notice them, for they&rsquo;d
have felt ashamed to be caught watching there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it was not himself?&rdquo; asked Hannah, catching
up her breath.</p>

<p>Molly gave her head a shake. &ldquo;No more than it
was you or me: it was his shadow. He walked on
up the path, looking neither to the right nor left, and
they lost sight of him. I was with mother when they
came home. Mary Clarkson, she came in with Beck,
and they said they had seen Tom Town, and supposed
he had gone out watching, too. Mother advised them
to hold their tongues: it didn&rsquo;t look well, she said,
for them two, only sickly young girls, to have run out
to the graveyard alone. A short while after, Tom
Town, in talking of that night, mother having artfully
led to it, said he had gone up to bed at nine with a
splitting headache, and forgot all about its being St.
Mark&rsquo;s Eve. When mother heard that, she turned the
colour o&rsquo; chalk, and looked round at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Tom Town died?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He died that blessed year; the very day that folks
was eating their Michaelmas gooses. A rapid decline
took him off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strange,&rdquo; said Hannah, musingly. &ldquo;People
believe here that the shadows appear, and folks used
to go watching, as it&rsquo;s said. I don&rsquo;t think many go
now. Did the two young women die?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not they. Becky&rsquo;s married, and got half-a-dozen
children; and Mary Clarkson, she went off to America.
Shouldn&rsquo;t you like to watch?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should,&rdquo; acknowledged Hannah; &ldquo;I would,
too, if I thought I should see anything. I&rsquo;ve said
more than once in my life that I should just like to
go out on St. Mark&rsquo;s Eve, and see whether there is
anything in it or not. My mother went, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll go, I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hannah made no answer to this at first. She sat
looking at the fire with a cross face. It had always a
cross look when she was deep in thought. &ldquo;The
mistress would think me such a fool, Molly, if she
came to know of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If! How could she come to know of it? Next
Monday will be the Easter holidays, and we mayn&rsquo;t
never have the opportunity again. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder
but the lane&rsquo;s full o&rsquo; watchers. St. Mark&rsquo;s Eve don&rsquo;t
often come on a Easter Monday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no time to go on with what they said. A
good half-hour the two sat there, laying their plans:
when once Hannah had decided to go in for the
expedition, she made no more bones over it. The
nursery-windows faced the front, and when the carriage
was heard driving in, they both decamped downstairs&mdash;Hannah
to the children, Molly to her kitchen. I
found Tod, and told him the news: Hannah and Molly
were going to watch in the churchyard for the shadows
on St. Mark&rsquo;s Eve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have some fun over this, Johnny,&rdquo; said he,
when he had done laughing. &ldquo;You and I will be on
to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monday came; and, upon my word, it seemed as if
things turned out on purpose. Mr. Todhetley went off
to Worcester with Dwarf Giles, on some business connected
with the Quarter Sessions, and was not expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
home until midnight, as he stayed to dine at Worcester.
Mrs. Todhetley had one of her excruciating face-aches,
and she went to bed when the children did&mdash;seven
o&rsquo;clock. Hannah had said in the morning that she
and Molly were going to spend an hour or two with
Goody Picker after the children were in bed; upon
which Mrs. Todhetley told her to get them to bed
early. It was something rare for Hannah to take any
holiday; she generally said she did not want it.
Goody Picker&rsquo;s husband used to be a gamekeeper&mdash;not
ours. Since his death she lived how she could, on her
vegetables, or by letting her odd room; Roger Monk
had it now. Sometimes she had her grandchild with
her; and the parents, well-to-do shopkeepers at
Alcester, paid her well. Goody Picker was thought
well of at our house, and came up occasionally to have
tea in the nursery with Hannah.</p>

<p>I was well by Monday; nothing but a bit of a cough
left; and Tod and I looked forward to the night&rsquo;s fun.
Not a word had we heard since; but we had seen the
two women-servants whispering together whenever
they got the chance; and so we knew they were going.
What Tod meant to do, he wouldn&rsquo;t tell me; I think
he hardly knew himself. The big turnips were all
gone, or he might have scooped one out for a death&rsquo;s
head, and stuck it on the gate-post, with a candle in it.</p>

<p>The night came. A clear night, with a miserable
moon. Miserable for our sport, because it was so
bright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pitch-dark night would have had some sense in
it, you know, Johnny,&rdquo; Tod remarked to me, as we
stood at the door, looking out. &ldquo;The moon should
hide her face on St. Mark&rsquo;s Eve.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as he spoke, the clock struck nine. Time to
be going. There was nobody to let or hinder us.
Mrs. Todhetley was in bed groaning with toothache;
old Thomas and Ph&oelig;be, neither of whom had cared to
take holiday, were at supper in the kitchen. She was
a young girl lately had in to help the housemaid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go on, Johnny; I&rsquo;ll follow presently. Take
your time; they won&rsquo;t go on the watch for this half-hour
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Tod, what is it that you are going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never you mind. If you hear a great noise, and
see a light blaze up, don&rsquo;t you be scared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I scared, Tod! That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Johnny. Take care not to be seen. It
might spoil sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The church was about half-a-mile from our house,
whether you crossed the fields to it or took the highway.
It stood back from the road, in its big churchyard.
A narrow lane, between two dwarf hedges, led
up from the road to the gate; it was hardly wide
enough for carriages; they wound round the open
road further on. A cross-path, shut in by two stiles,
led right across the lane near to the churchyard gate.
Stories went that a poor fellow who had hung himself
about twenty years ago was buried by torchlight
under that very crossing, with never a parson to say
a prayer over him.</p>

<p>We guessed where the women would stand&mdash;at one
of these crossing stiles, with the gate and the churchyard
in full view. As Tod said, it stood to reason
that shadows and the watchers for them would not
choose the broader road, where all was open, and not
so much as a tree grew for shelter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>I stole along cautiously, taking the roadway and
keeping under shade of the hedge, and got there all
right. Not a creature was about. The old grey
church, built of stone, the many-shaped graves in the
churchyard, stood white and cold in the moonlight. I
went behind the cross-stile at the side furthest from
our house, and leaned over it, looking up and down
the lane. That the women would be on the opposite
side was certain, because the churchyard gate could
not be seen so well from this.</p>

<p>The old clock did not tell the quarters, only struck
the hour; time went on, and I began to wonder how
long I was to wait. It must be turned half-past nine;
getting nearer to a quarter to ten; and still nobody
came. Where were the watchers? And where was
Tod? The shadows of the trees, of the hedges, of the
graves, fell in distinct lines on the grass; and I don&rsquo;t
mind confessing that it felt uncommonly lonely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou!&rdquo; burst forth over my head
with a sudden and unearthly sound. I started back
in a fright for one moment, and called myself an idiot
the next, for it was only an owl. It had come flying
forth from the old belfry, and went rushing on with
its great wings, crying still, but changing its note.
&ldquo;Tu-whit; tu-whoo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And while I watched the owl, other sounds, as of
whispering, made themselves manifest, heralding the
approach of the women from the opposite field, making
for the stile in front of me, through the little copse.
Drawing behind the low hedge, to sit down on the
stump of a tree, I pushed my head forward, and took
a look at them through the lower bars of the stile.
They were standing at the other, in their light shawls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and new Easter straw-bonnets; Molly&rsquo;s trimmed with
green, Hannah&rsquo;s with primrose. The moonlight fell
full on their faces&mdash;mine was in the shade. But they
might see me, and I drew back again.</p>

<p>Presently they began to gabble; in low tones at
first, which increased, perhaps unconsciously to themselves,
to higher ones. They said how lonely it was,
especially with &ldquo;them grave-marks&rdquo; in view close by;
and they speculated upon whether any shadows would
appear to them. My sense of loneliness had vanished.
To have two practical women, each of them a good
five-and-thirty, for neighbours, took it off. But I
wondered what had become of Tod.</p>

<p>Another owl! or perhaps the last one coming back
again. It was not so startling a noise as before, and
created no alarm. I thought it a good opportunity to
steal another look, and propelled my head forward an
inch at a time. Their two faces were turned upwards,
watching the owl&rsquo;s flight towards the belfry.</p>

<p>But to my intense astonishment there was a <em>third</em>
face. A face behind them peeping out from the close
folds of a mantle, and almost resting on their shoulders.
At the first moment I thought of Tod; but soon the
features became familiar to me in the bright light, and
I knew them for Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s. Ph&oelig;be, whom I had left
in the kitchen, supping quietly! That she had stolen
up unseen and unheard while they talked, was
apparent.</p>

<p>A wild screech! Two wild screeches. Ph&oelig;be had
put her hands on the startled women, and given vent
to a dismal groan. <em>She</em> laughed: but the others went
into a desperate passion. First at having been
frightened, next at having been followed. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
matters came to be investigated later, it turned out
that Ph&oelig;be had overheard a conversation between
Molly and Hannah, which betrayed what they were
about to do, and had come on purpose to startle them.</p>

<p>A row ensued. Bitter words on both sides; mutual
abusings. The elder servants ordered Ph&oelig;be home;
she refused to go, and gave them some sauce. She
intended to stay and see what there was to be seen,
she said; for all she could tell, <em>their</em> shadows might
pass, and a good thing if they did; let alone that
she&rsquo;d not dare to go back by herself at that hour and
meet the ghosts. Hannah and Molly cut the matter
short by leaving the stile to her; they went round,
and took up their places by the churchyard gate.</p>

<p>It seems very stupid to be writing of this, I dare
say; it must read like an old ghost-story out of a
fable-book; but every word is true, as the people that
lived round us then could tell you.</p>

<p>There we waited; Hannah and Molly gathered
close against the hedge by the churchyard gate;
Ph&oelig;be, wrapped in her shawl, leaning on the top of
the stile; I on the old tree stump, feeling inclined to
go to sleep. It seemed a long time, and the night
grew cold. Evidently there were no watchers for St.
Mark&rsquo;s shadows abroad that night, except ourselves.
Without warning, the old clock boomed out the
strokes of the hour. Ten.</p>

<p>Did you ever have the opportunity of noticing how
long it takes for a sound like this to die quite away
on the calm night-air? I seemed to hear it still,
floating off in the distance, when I became aware that
some figure was advancing up the lane towards us
with a rather swift step. It&rsquo;s Tod this time, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
thought, and naturally looked out; and I don&rsquo;t mind
telling that I caught hold of the bars of the stile for
companionship, in my shock of terror.</p>

<p>I had never seen the dead walking; but I do believe
I thought I saw it then. It looked like a corpse in
its winding-sheet; whether man or woman, none
could tell. An ashey-white, still, ghastly face, enveloped
around with bands of white linen, was turned full to
the moonlight, that played upon the rigid features.
The whole person, from the crown of the head to the
soles of the feet, was enshrouded in a white garment.
All thoughts of Tod went out of me; and I&rsquo;m not
sure but my hair rose up on end as the thing came
on. You may laugh at me, all of you, but just you
go and try it.</p>

<p>My fear went for nothing, however; it didn&rsquo;t
damage me. Of all the awful cries ever heard, shrill
at first, changing to something like the barking of a
dog afterwards, those were the worst that arose opposite.
They came from Ph&oelig;be. The girl had stood petrified,
with straining eyes and laboured breath, like one who
has not the power to fly, while the thing advanced.
Only when it stopped close and looked at her did the
pent-up cries come forth. Then she turned to fly, and
the white figure leaped the stile, and went after her
into the copse. What immediately followed I cannot
remember&mdash;never could remember it; but it seemed
that not more than a minute had elapsed when I and
Molly and Hannah were standing over Ph&oelig;be, lying
in convulsions on the ground, and the creature nowhere
to be seen. The cries had been heard in the road, and
some people passing came running up. They lifted
the girl in their arms, and bore her homewards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>My senses were coming to me, showing plainly
enough that it was no &ldquo;shadow,&rdquo; but some ill-starred
individual dressed up to personate one. Poor Ph&oelig;be!
I could hear her cries still, though the group was
already out of the copse and crossing the open field
beyond. Somebody touched me on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tod! Did you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; asked Tod, who was out of breath
with running. &ldquo;What was all that row?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him. Somebody had made himself into a
ghost, with a tied-up whitened face, just as the dead
have, and came up the Green Lane in a sheet; and
Ph&oelig;be was being carried home in convulsions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a fool, Johnny,&rdquo; was his wrathful answer.
&ldquo;I am not one to risk a thing of that sort, not even
for those two old women we came out to frighten.
Look here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went to the edge of the copse near the road, and
showed me some things&mdash;the old pistol from the
stable, and gunpowder lights that went off with a
crash yards high. It&rsquo;s not of much use going into it
now. Tod had meant, standing at a safe distance, to
set a light to the explosive articles, and fire off his
pistol at the same time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have been so good to see the women
scutter off in their fright, Johnny; and it couldn&rsquo;t
have hurt them. They might have looked upon it as
the blue-light from below.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made you so late?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Late!&rdquo; returned Tod, savagely; &ldquo;I am late, and
the fun&rsquo;s spoilt. That confounded old Duff and his
cane came in to see you, Johnny, just as I was starting;
there was nobody else, and I couldn&rsquo;t leave him. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
said you were in bed and asleep, but it didn&rsquo;t send him
away. Down he sat, telling a tale of how hard-worked
he&rsquo;d been all day, and asking for brandy-and-water.
The dickens take him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, Tod, it was really not you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you repeat that again, Johnny, I&rsquo;ll strike you.
I swear it was not me. There! I never told you a
lie yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He never had; and from that moment of strong
denial I know that Tod had no more to do with the
matter than I had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder who it could have been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find that out, as sure as my name&rsquo;s Todhetley,&rdquo;
he said, catching up his pistols and lights.</p>

<p>We ran all the way home, looking out in vain for
the ghost on our way, and got in almost as soon as
the rest. What a hullabaloo it was! They put a
mattress on the kitchen floor, and laid Ph&oelig;be on it.
Mr. Duffham was upon the scene in no time; the
Squire had returned earlier than was thought for, and
Mrs. Todhetley came down with her face smothered
in a woollen handkerchief.</p>

<p>As to any concealment now, it was useless to think
of it. None was attempted, and Molly and Hannah
had to confess that they went out to watch for the
shadows. The Squire blustered at them a little, but
Mrs. Todhetley said the keenest thing, in her mild
way:</p>

<p>&ldquo;At your age, Hannah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have known a person rendered an idiot for life
with a less fright than this,&rdquo; said old Duff, turning
round to speak. &ldquo;It was the following her that did
the mischief.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing could be done that night as to investigation;
but with the morning the Squire entered upon
it in hot anger. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t the fool have been contented
with what he&rsquo;d already done, without going
over the stile after her? If I spend a fifty-pound
note, I&rsquo;ll unearth him. It looks to me uncommonly
like a trick you two boys would play,&rdquo; he added,
turning sharply upon me and Tod.</p>

<p>And the suspicion made us all the more eager to
find out the real fox. But not a clue could we discover.
Nobody had known of the proposed expedition
except Goody Picker; and she, as everybody
testified, was true to the backbone. As the day
went on, and nothing came of it, Tod had one of his
stamping fits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If one could find out whether it was man or
woman! If one could divine how they got at the
knowledge!&rdquo; stamped Tod. &ldquo;The pater does not look
sure about us yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it could have been Roger Monk?&rdquo; I
said, speaking out a thought that had been dimly
creeping up in my mind by starts all day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roger Monk!&rdquo; repeated Tod, &ldquo;why pitch upon
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only that it&rsquo;s just possible he might have got it
out of Goody Picker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away went Tod, in his straightforward fashion, to
look for Roger Monk. He was in the hot-house, doing
something to his plants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monk, did you play that trick last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What trick, sir?&rdquo; asked Monk, twitching a good-for-nothing
leaf off a budding geranium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What trick! As if there were more tricks than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
one played! I mean dressing yourself up like a dead
man, and frightening Ph&oelig;be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have too much to do with my work, Mr. Todhetley,
to find time to play tricks. I took no holiday
at all yesterday, day or night, but was about my
business till I went to bed. They were saying out
here this morning that the Squire thought <em>you</em> had
done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be insolent, Monk. That won&rsquo;t answer
with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, it is not pleasant to be accused point-blank
of a crime, as you&rsquo;ve just accused me. I know
nothing at all about the matter. &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t me. I had
no grudge against Ph&oelig;be, that I should harm her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod was satisfied; I was not. He never once
looked in either of our faces as he was speaking. We
leaped the wire-fence and went across to Goody
Picker&rsquo;s, bursting into her kitchen without ceremony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Mrs. Picker, we can&rsquo;t find out anything
about that business last night,&rdquo; began Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you never will, gentlemen, as is my opinion,&rdquo;
returned Mrs. Picker, getting up in a bustle and dusting
two wooden chairs. &ldquo;Whoever did that, have
took himself off for a bit; never doubt it. &rsquo;Twas
some one o&rsquo; them village lads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been wondering whether it was Roger
Monk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawk-a-mercy!&rdquo; cried she, dropping a basin on the
brick floor. And if ever I saw a woman change
colour, she did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you sent me into a tremble, gentlemen,
saying that,&rdquo; she answered, stooping to pick up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
broken crockery. &ldquo;A young man lodging in my
place, do such a villain&rsquo;s trick! I&rsquo;d not like to think
it; I shouldn&rsquo;t rest in my bed. The two servants
having started right out from here for the churchyard
have cowed-down my heart bad enough, without more
ill news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time did Monk come in last night?&rdquo; questioned
Tod. &ldquo;Do you remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He come in after Mrs. Hannah and the other had
gone,&rdquo; she replied, taking a moment&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;Close
upon it; I&rsquo;d hardly shut my door on them when I
had to open it to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he go out again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not he, sir. He eat his supper, telling me in a
grumbling tone about the extra work he&rsquo;d had to do
in the greenhouses and places, because the other man
had took holiday best part o&rsquo; the day. And then he
went up to bed. Right tired he seemed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We left her fitting the pieces of the basin together,
and went home. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Monk,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;But
now&mdash;where to look for the right man, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Look as we might, we did not find him. Ph&oelig;be
was better in a day or two, but the convulsive fits
stuck to her, coming on at all sorts of unexpected
times. Old Duff thought it might end in insanity.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s what came of Watching for the Shadows
on St. Mark&rsquo;s Eve!</p>

<h2>SANKER&rsquo;S VISIT.</h2>


<p>His name was Sanker, and he was related to Mrs.
Todhetley. Not expecting to go home for the holidays&mdash;for
his people lived in some far-off district of Wales,
and did not afford him the journey&mdash;Tod invited him
to spend them with us at Dyke Manor: which was
uncommonly generous, for he disliked Sanker beyond
everything. Having plenty of money himself, Tod
could not bear that a connection of his should be
known as nearly the poorest and meanest in the school,
and resented it awfully. But he could not be ill-natured,
for all his prejudices, and he asked Sanker to
go home with us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s slow there,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;not much going on in
summer besides haymaking; but it may be an improvement
on this. So, if you&rsquo;d like to come, I&rsquo;ll write and
tell them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Sanker; &ldquo;I should like it very
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Things had been queer at school as the term drew
to its close. Petty pilferings were taking place;
articles and money alike disappeared. Tod lost half-a-sovereign;
one of the masters some silver; Bill
Whitney put sevenpence halfpenny and a set of
enamelled studs into his desk one day, never to see
either again; and Snepp, who had been home to his
sister&rsquo;s marriage, lost a piece of wedding-cake out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
his box the night he came back. There was a thief
in the school, and no clue to him. One might mentally
accuse this fellow, another that; but not a shadow of
proof was there against any. Altogether we were not
sorry to get away.</p>

<p>But the curious thing was, that soon after we got
home pilferings began there. Ned Banker was well
received; and Tod, regarding himself in the capacity
of host, grew more cordial with him than he had been
at school. It was a sort of noblesse oblige feeling.
Sanker was sixteen; stout and round; not tall; with
pale eyes and a dull face. He was to be a clergyman;
funds at his home permitting. His father lived at some
mines in Wales. Tod wondered in what capacity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sanker was a gentleman born and bred,&rdquo;
explained Mrs. Todhetley. &ldquo;He never had much
money; but what little it was he lost, speculating in
this very mine. After that, when he had nothing in
the world left to live upon, and a wife and several
young children to keep, he was thankful to take a
situation as over-looker at a small yearly salary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had been home about a week when the first
thing was missed. At one side of the house, in a sort
of nook, was a square room, its glass-doors opening on
the gravel-path that skirted the hedge of the vegetable
garden. Squire Todhetley kept his farming accounts
there and wrote his letters. A barometer and two
county maps, Worcestershire and Warwickshire, on its
walls, a square of matting on its floor, an upright
bureau, a table, some chairs; and there you have the
picture of the room.</p>

<p>One afternoon&mdash;mind! we did not know this for a
week after, but it is as well to tell of it as it occurred&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
was sitting at the table in this room, his account-books,
kept in the bureau, open before him; his inkstand
and cash-box at hand. Lying near the cash-box
was a five-pound note, open; the Squire had put it
out for Dwarf Giles to get changed at Alcester. He
was writing an order for some things that Giles would
have to bring back, when Rimmell, who acted as
working bailiff on the estate, came to the glass-doors,
open to the warm June air, saying he had received an
offer for the wheat that had spurted. The Squire
stepped outside on the gravel-path while he talked
with Rimmell, and then strolled round with him to the
fold-yard. He was away&mdash;that is, out of sight of the
room&mdash;about three minutes, and when he got back
the note was gone.</p>

<p>He could not believe his own eyes. It was a calm
day; no wind stirring. He lifted the things on the
table; he lifted the matting on the floor; he shook his
loose coat; all in vain. Standing at the door, he
shouted aloud; he walked along the path to the front
of the house, and shouted there; but was not answered.
So far as could be seen, no person whatever was about
who could have come round to the room during his
short absence.</p>

<p>Striding back to the room, he went through it, and
up the passage to the hall, his boots creaking. Molly
was in the kitchen, singing over her work; Ph&oelig;be
and Hannah were heard talking upstairs; and Mrs.
Todhetley stood in the store-room, doing something
to the last year&rsquo;s pots of jam. She said, on being
questioned, that no one had passed to the passage
leading to the Squire&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>It happened at that moment, that I, coming home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
from the Dyke, ran into the hall, full butt against the
Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;where are you all? What are
you up to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had been at the Dyke all the afternoon with Tod
and Hugh; they were there still. Not Sanker: he
was outside, on the lawn, reading. This I told the
pater, and he said no more. Later, when we came to
know what had happened, he mentioned to us that, at
this time, no idea of robbery had entered his head;
he thought one of us might have hidden the money in
sport.</p>

<p>So much an impossibility did it appear of the note&rsquo;s
having been lifted by human hands, that the Squire
went back to his room in a maze. He could only
think that it must have attached itself to his clothes,
and dropped off them in the fold-yard. What had
become of it, goodness knew; whether it had fluttered
into the pond, or the hens had scratched it to pieces,
or the turkeys gobbled it up; he searched fruitlessly.</p>

<p>That was on a Thursday. On the following Thursday,
when Tod was lying on the lawn bench on his
back, playing with his tame magpie, and teasing Hugh
and Lena, the pater&rsquo;s voice was heard calling to him
in a sharp, quick tone, as if something was the matter.
Tod got up and went round by the gravel-path to
whence the sound came, and I followed. The Squire
was standing at the window of the room, half in, half
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you, Johnny. Stay, though,&rdquo; he
added, after a moment, &ldquo;you may as well be told&mdash;why
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat down in his place at the table. Tod stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
just inside the door, paying more attention to the
magpie, which he had brought on his arm, than to his
father: I leaned against the bureau. There was a
minute&rsquo;s silence, waiting for the Squire to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put that wretched bird down,&rdquo; he said; and we
knew something had put him out, for he rarely spoke
with sharpness to Tod.</p>

<p>Tod sent the magpie off, and came in. The first
day we got home from school, Tod had rescued the
magpie from Goody Picker&rsquo;s grandson; he caught him
pulling the feathers out of its tail; gave him sixpence
for it, and brought it home. A poor, miserable, half-starved
thing, that somebody had taught to say continually,
&ldquo;Now then, Peter.&rdquo; Tod meant to feed it
into condition; but the pater had not taken kindly to
the bird; he said it would be better dead than alive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that I heard you boys talking of the
other day, about some petty pilferings in your school?&rdquo;
he asked, abruptly. And we gave him the history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as it seems to me, the same thing is going
on here,&rdquo; he continued, looking at us both. &ldquo;Johnny,
sit down; I can&rsquo;t talk while you sway about like
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same thing going on here, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say that it seems so,&rdquo; said the pater, thrusting
both his hands deep into his trousers&rsquo; pockets, and
rattling the silver in them. &ldquo;Last Thursday, this
day week, a bank-note lay on my table here. I just
went round to the yard with Rimmell, and when I
got back the note was gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did it go to?&rdquo; asked Tod, practically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just the question&mdash;where? I concluded
that it must have stuck to my coat in some unaccountable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
way, and got lost out-of-doors. I don&rsquo;t conclude
so now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod seemed to take the news in his usual careless
fashion, and kept privately telegraphing signs to the
magpie, sitting now on the old tree-stump opposite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think now, Joe, that somebody came in at these
open doors, and <em>took</em> the note,&rdquo; said the pater, impressively.
&ldquo;And I want to find out who it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then, Peter!&rdquo; cried the bird, hopping down
on the gravel; at which Tod laughed. The Squire
got up in a rage, and shut the doors with a bang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t be serious for a few moments, you
had better say so. I can tell you this is likely to turn
out no laughing business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod turned his back to the glass-doors, and left the
magpie to its devices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever it was, contrived to slip round here from
the front, during my temporary absence; possibly
without ill intention: the sight of the note lying open
might have proved too strong a temptation for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Him!&rdquo; put in Tod, critically. &ldquo;It might have
been a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might be a jackass: and often are one,&rdquo; said
the pater. And it struck us both, from the affable
retort, that his suspicions were pointing to some
particular person of the male gender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This morning, after breakfast, I was here, writing
a letter,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;While sealing it, Thomas
called me away in a hurry, and I was absent the best
part of an hour. When I got back, my ring had disappeared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your ring, sir!&rdquo; cried Tod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my ring, sir,&rdquo; mocked the pater; for he
thought we were taking up the matter lightly, and it
nettled him. &ldquo;I left it on the seal, expecting to find
it there when I returned. Not so. The ring had
gone, and the letter lay on the ground. We have got
a thief about the house, boys&mdash;a thief&mdash;within or
without. Just the same sort of thief, as it seems to
me, that you had at school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod suddenly leaned forward, his elbow on his
knee, his whole interest aroused. Some unpleasant
doubt had struck him, as was evident by the flush
upon his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, anybody that might be about, back or
front, could find their way down here if they pleased,&rdquo;
he slowly said. &ldquo;Tramps get in sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rarely, without being noticed. Who did you boys
see about the place that afternoon&mdash;tramp or gentleman?
Come! You were at the house, Johnny: you
bolted into it, head foremost, saying you had come
from the Dyke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw a soul but Sanker: he was on the
bench on the lawn, reading. I said so at the time,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! yes; Sanker was there reading,&rdquo; quietly
assented the Squire. &ldquo;What were you hastening
home for, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if that mattered, or could have had anything to
do with it! He had a knack of asking unpleasant
questions; and I looked at Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hugh got his blouse torn, and Johnny came in to
get another,&rdquo; acknowledged Tod, readily. The fact
was, Hugh&rsquo;s clothes that afternoon had come to uncommon
grief. Hannah had made one of her usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
rows over it, and afterwards shown the things to Mrs.
Todhetley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and now for to-day,&rdquo; resumed the pater.
&ldquo;Where have you all been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Where had we not? In the three-cornered paddock;
with Monk in the pine-house; away in the rick-yard;
once to the hay-field; at the rabbit-hutches; round at
the stables; oh, everywhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You two, and Sanker?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not Sanker,&rdquo; I said. Sanker stayed on the lawn
with his book. We had all been on the lawn for the
last half-hour: he, us, Hugh, Lena, and the magpie.
But not a suspicious character of any sort had we
seen about the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sanker&rsquo;s fond of reading on the lawn,&rdquo; remarked
Mr. Todhetley, in a careless tone. But he got no
answer: we had been struck into silence.</p>

<p>He took one hand out of his pocket, and drummed
on the table, not looking at either of us. Tod had
laid hold of a piece of blotting-paper and was pulling
it to pieces. I wondered what they were thinking
of: I know what I was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate, the first thing is to find the ring;
<em>that</em> only went this morning,&rdquo; said the Squire, as he
left us. Tod sat on where he was, dropping the bits
of paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Tod, do you think it <em>could</em> be&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Johnny!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;No, I
don&rsquo;t think it. The bank-note&mdash;light, flimsy thing&mdash;must
have been lost in the yard, and the ring will
turn up. It&rsquo;s somewhere on the floor here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In five minutes the news had spread. Mr. Todhetley
had told his wife, and summoned the servants to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
search. Both losses were made known; consternation
fell on the household; the women-servants searched
the room; old Thomas bent his back double over the
frame outside the glass-doors. But there was no
ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is just like the mysterious losses we had at
school,&rdquo; exclaimed Sanker, as a lot of us were standing
in the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, <em>it is</em>,&rdquo; said the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, sir, your ring is in a corner of some odd
pocket?&rdquo; went on Sanker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it may be,&rdquo; answered the Squire, rather
emphatically; &ldquo;but not in mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Happening to look at Mrs. Todhetley, I saw her
face had turned to a white fright. Whether the
remark of Sanker or the peculiarity of the Squire&rsquo;s
manner brought to her mind the strange coincidence
of the losses, here and at school, certain it was the
doubt had dawned upon her. Later, when I and Tod
were hunting in the room on our own account, she
came to us with her terror-stricken face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joseph, I see what you are thinking,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;but it can&rsquo;t be; it can&rsquo;t be. If the Sankers are
poor, they are honest. I wish you knew his father
and mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not accused any one, Mrs. Todhetley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; neither has your father; but you suspect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better not talk of it,&rdquo; said Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joseph, I think we must talk of it, and see what
can be done. If&mdash;if he should have done such a thing,
of course he cannot stay here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t know that he has, therefore he ought
not to be accused of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Joseph, don&rsquo;t you see the pain? None of
you can feel this as I do. He is my relative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt so sorry for her. With the trouble in her
pale, mild eyes, and the quivering of her thin, meek
lips. It was quite evident that <em>she</em> feared the worst:
and Tod threw away concealment with his step-mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must not accuse him; we must not let it be
known that we suspect him,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the matter
here can be hushed up&mdash;got over&mdash;but were suspicion
once directed to him on the score of the school losses,
the disgrace would never be lived down, now or later.
It would cling to him through life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Todhetley clasped her slender and rather bony
fingers, from which the wedding-ring looked always
ready to drop off. &ldquo;Joseph,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you assume
confidently that he has done it; I see that. Perhaps
you know he has? Perhaps you have some proof
that you are concealing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, on my honour. But for my father&rsquo;s laying stress
on the curious coincidence of the disappearances
at school I should not have thought of Sanker. &lsquo;Losses
there; losses here,&rsquo; he said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then, Peter!&rdquo; mocked the bird, from his
perch on the old tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo; shouted Tod. &ldquo;And then the Squire
went on adroitly to the fact, without putting it into
words, that nobody else seems to have been within
hail of this room either time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has had so few advantages; he is kept so
short of money,&rdquo; murmured poor Mrs. Todhetley, seeking
to find an excuse for him. &ldquo;I would almost rather
have found my boy Hugh&mdash;when he shall be old
enough&mdash;guilty of such a thing, than Edward Sanker.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d a great deal rather it had been me,&rdquo; I exclaimed.
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have felt half so uncomfortable.
And we are not <em>sure</em>. Can&rsquo;t we keep him here, after all?
It will be an awful thing to turn him out&mdash;a thief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not going to be turned out, a thief. Don&rsquo;t
put in your oar, Johnny. The pater intends to hush
it up. Why! had he suspected any other living
mortal about the place, except Sanker, he&rsquo;d have
accused them outright, and sent for old Jones in hot
haste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Todhetley, holding her hand to her troubled
face, looked at Tod as he spoke. &ldquo;I am not sure,
Joseph&mdash;I don&rsquo;t quite know whether to hush it up
entirely will be for the best. If he&mdash;&mdash; Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exclamation came out with a shriek. We
turned at it, having been standing together at the
table, our backs to the window. There stood Sanker.
How long he had been there was uncertain; quite
long enough to hear and comprehend. His face was
livid with passion, his voice hoarse with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that <em>I</em> am accused of taking the
bank-note and the ring?&mdash;of having been the thief at
school? I thank you, Joseph Todhetley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Todhetley, always for peace, ran before him,
and took his hands. Her gentle words were drowned&mdash;Tod&rsquo;s
were overpowered. When quiet fellows like
Sanker do get into a rage, it&rsquo;s something bad to
witness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, old fellow,&rdquo; said Tod, in a breath of
silence; &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t accuse you, and don&rsquo;t wish to
accuse you. The things going here, as they did at
school, is an unfortunate coincidence; you can&rsquo;t shut
your eyes to it; but as to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are <em>you</em> not accused?&mdash;why&rsquo;s Ludlow not
accused?&mdash;you were both at school, as well as I; and
you are both here,&rdquo; raved Sanker, panting like a wild
animal. &ldquo;You have money, both of you; you don&rsquo;t
want helping on in life; I have only my good name.
And that you would take from me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edward, Edward! we did not wish to accuse
you; we said we would not accuse you,&rdquo; cried poor
Mrs. Todhetley in her simplicity. But his voice
broke in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; you only suspected me. You assumed my
guilt, and would not be honest enough to accuse me,
lest I refuted it. Not another hour will I stay in this
house. Come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, Sanker! If we are wrong&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be silent!&rdquo; he cried, turning savagely on Tod.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not strong; no match for you, or I would pound
you to atoms! Let me go my own way now. You
go yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half dragging, half leading Mrs. Todhetley with
him, the angry light in his eyes frightening her, he
went to his bedroom. Taking off his jacket; turning
his pockets inside out; emptying the contents of his
trunk on the floor, he scattered the articles, one by
one, with the view of showing that he had nothing
concealed belonging to other people. Mrs. Todhetley,
great in quiet emergencies, had her senses hopelessly
scared away in this; she could only cry, and implore
of him to be reasonable. He flung back his things,
and in five minutes was gone. Dragging his box
down the stairs by its stout cord, he managed to hoist
it on his shoulders, and they saw him go fiercely off
across the lawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>I met him in the plantation, beyond the Dyke.
Mrs. Todhetley, awfully distressed, sent me flying
away to find the pater; she mistakenly thought he
might be at Rimmell&rsquo;s, who lived in a cottage beyond
it. Running home through the trees, I came upon
Sanker. He was sitting on his box, crying; great big
sobs bursting from him. Of course he could not carry
<em>that</em> far. Down I sat by him, and put my hand on
his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Sanker! don&rsquo;t, old fellow! Come back
and have it cleared up. I dare say they are all wrong
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His angry mood had changed. Those fierce whirlwinds
of passion are generally followed by depression.
He did not seem to care an atom for his sobs, or for
my seeing them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the cruelest wrong I ever had dealt to me,
Johnny. Why should they pitch upon <em>me</em>? What
have they seen in me that they should set me down
as a thief?&mdash;and such a thief! Why, the very
thought of it, if they send her word, will kill my
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do it, Sanker. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got up, and raised his hand solemnly to the blue
sky, just as a man might have done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear I did not. I swear I never laid finger on
a thing in your house, or at school, that was not mine.
God hears me say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now you&rsquo;ll come back with me, Ned. The
box will take no harm here till we send for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back with you! that I never will. Fare you
well, Johnny: I&rsquo;ll wish it to <em>you</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business. Look here; I was more
generous than some of you have been. All along, I
felt as <em>sure</em> who it was, cribbing those things at school,
as though I had seen it done; but I never told. I
just whispered to the fellow, when we were parting:
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you go in for the same game next half, or I
shall have you dropped upon;&rsquo; and I don&rsquo;t think he
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;which was it?&rdquo; I cried, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No: give him a chance. It was neither you nor
me, and that&rsquo;s enough to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hoisting the box up on to the projecting edge of
a tree, he got it on his shoulders again. Certain of
his innocence then, I was in an agony to get him
back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s of no use, Johnny. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sanker! Ned! The Squire will be fit to smother
us all, when he finds you are off; Mrs. Todhetley is in
dreadful grief. Such an unpleasant thing has never
before happened with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; was all he repeated, marching resolutely
off, with the black box held safe by the cord.</p>

<p>Fit to smother us? I thought the pater would
have done it, when he came home late in the afternoon;
laying the blame of Sanker&rsquo;s going, first on Mrs.
Todhetley, then on Tod, then on me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; he asked, looking at us all
helplessly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have had it come out for the
world. Think of his parents&mdash;of his own prospects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He never did it, sir,&rdquo; I said, speaking up; &ldquo;he
swore it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pater gave a sniff. &ldquo;Swearing does not go for
much in such cases, I&rsquo;m afraid, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>It was so hopeless, the making them understand
Sanker&rsquo;s solemn truth as he did swear it, that I held
my tongue. I told Tod; also, what he had said about
the fellow he suspected at school; but Tod only curled
his lip, and quietly reminded me that I should never
be anything but a muff.</p>

<p>Three or four days passed on. We could not learn
where Sanker went to, or what had become of him;
nothing about him except the fact that he had left his
box at Goody Picker&rsquo;s cottage, asking her to take
charge of it until it was sent for. Mrs. Todhetley
would not write to Wales, or to the school, for fear
of making mischief. I know this: it was altogether
a disagreeable remembrance, whichever way we looked
at it, but I was the only one who believed in his
innocence.</p>

<p>On the Monday another loss occurred; not one of
value in itself, but uncommonly significant. Since the
explosion, Mrs. Todhetley had moved about the house
restlessly, more like a fish out of water than a reasonable
woman, following the Squire to his room, and
staying there to talk with him, as she never had
before. It was always in her head to do something
to mend matters; but, what, she could not tell; hence
her talkings with the pater. As each day passed,
bringing no news of Sanker, she grew more anxious
and fidgety. While he was in his room on the Monday
morning, she came in with her work. It was the
unpicking some blue ribbons from a white body of
Lena&rsquo;s. There had been a child&rsquo;s party at the Stirlings&rsquo;
(they were always giving them), and Lena had a new
frock for it. The dressmaker had put a glistening
glass thing, as big as a pea, in the bows that tied up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the sleeves. They looked like diamonds. The pater
made a fuss after we got home, saying it was inconsistent
at the best; she was too young for real diamonds,
and he would not have her wear mock rubbish. Well,
Mrs. Todhetley had the frock in her hand, taking these
bows off, when she came to the Squire on the Monday
morning, chattering and lamenting. I saw and heard
her. On going away she accidentally left one of them
on the table. The Squire went about as usual, dodging
in and out of the room at intervals like a dog in a
fair. I sat on the low seat, on the other side of the
hedge, in the vegetable garden, making a fishing-line
and flinging stones at the magpie whenever he came
up to his perch on the old tree&rsquo;s stump. All was still;
nothing to be heard but his occasional croak, &ldquo;Now
then, Peter!&rdquo; Presently I caught a soft low whistle
behind me. Looking through the hedge, I saw Roger
Monk coming out of the room with stealthy steps, and
going off towards his greenhouses. I thought nothing
of it; it was his ordinary way of walking; but he
must have come up to the room very quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; came the Squire&rsquo;s voice by-and-by, and
I ran round: he had seen me sitting there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny, have you a mind for a walk to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had got thus far when Mrs. Todhetley came in
by the inner door, and began looking on the table.
Nothing in the world was on it except the inkstand,
the <cite>Worcester Herald</cite>, and the papers before the
Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must have left one of the blue knots here,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did; I saw it,&rdquo; said the Squire; and he took
up his papers one by one, and shook the newspaper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, the blue shoulder-knot was gone. Just as
we had searched for the ring, we searched for that:
under the matting, and above the matting, and everywhere;
I and those two. A grim look came over the
Squire&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thief is amongst us still. He has taken that
glittering paste thing for a diamond. This clears
Sanker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Todhetley burst into glad sobs. I had never
seen her so excited; you might have thought her
an hysterical girl. She would do all sorts of things
at once; the least of which was, starting in a post-chaise-and-four
for Wales.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do nothing,&rdquo; said the Squire, with authority. &ldquo;I
had news of Sanker this morning, and he&rsquo;s back at
school. He wrote me a letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, why did you not show it me?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Todhetley, through her tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s a trifle abusive; actionable, a lawyer
might say,&rdquo; he answered, stopping a laugh. &ldquo;Ah! ha!
a big diamond! I&rsquo;m as glad of this as if anybody had
left me a thousand pounds,&rdquo; continued the good old
pater. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not had that boy out of my head since,
night or day. We&rsquo;ll have him back to finish his
holidays&mdash;eh, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether I went along on my head or my tail, doing
the Squire&rsquo;s errand, I didn&rsquo;t exactly know. To my
mind the thief stood disclosed&mdash;Roger Monk. But I
did not much like to betray him to the Squire. As
a compromise between duty and disinclination, I told
Tod. He went straight off to the Squire, and Roger
Monk was ordered to the room.</p>

<p>He did not take the accusation as Sanker took it&mdash;noisily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
About as cool and hardy as any fellow could
be, stood he; white, angry retaliation shining from
his sullen face. And, for once, he looked full at the
Squire as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the second time I have been accused
wrongfully by you or yours, sir. You must prove
your words. A bank-note, a ring, a false diamond
(taken to be a true one), in a blue ribbon; and I have
stolen them. If you don&rsquo;t either prove your charge
to be true, or withdraw the imputation, the law shall
make you, Mr. Todhetley. I am down in the world,
obliged to take a common situation for a while; but
that&rsquo;s no reason why I should be browbeat and put
upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somehow, the words, or the manner, told upon the
Squire. He was not feeling sure of his grounds.
Until then he had never cast a thought of ill on Roger
Monk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you doing here, Monk? What made
you come up stealthily, and creep stealthily away
again?&rdquo; demanded Tod, who had assumed the guilt
out and out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to what I was doing here, I came to ask a
question about my work,&rdquo; coolly returned Monk. &ldquo;I
walked slowly, not stealthily; the day&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better turn out your pockets, Monk,&rdquo; said
the Squire.</p>

<p>He did so at once, just as Sanker had done unbidden,
biting his lips to get some colour into them.
Lots of odds and ends of things were there; string,
nails, a tobacco-pipe, halfpence, and such like; but no
blue bow. I don&rsquo;t think the Squire knew whether to
let him off as innocent, or to give him into custody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
as guilty. At any rate, he seemed to be in hesitation,
when who should appear on the scene but Goody
Picker. The turned-out pockets, Monk&rsquo;s aspect, and
the few words she caught, told the tale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, Squire&mdash;if you please, young
masters,&rdquo; she began, dropping a curtsy to us in
succession; &ldquo;the mistress told me to come round here.
Stepping up this morning about a job o&rsquo; work I&rsquo;m
doing&mdash;for Mrs. Hannah, I heard of the losses that have
took place, apperiently thefts. So I up and spoke;
and Hannah took me to the mistress; and the mistress,
who had got her gownd off a-changing of it, listened
to what I had to say, and telled me to come round
at once to Mr. Todhetley. (Don&rsquo;t you be frighted,
Monk.) Sir, young gentlemen, I think it might have
been the magpie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think who might have been the magpie?&rdquo; asked
the Squire, puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What stole the things. Sir, that there pie, bought
only t&rsquo;other day from my gran&rsquo;son by young Mr.
Todhetley, was turned out o&rsquo; my son Peter&rsquo;s home at
Alcester for thieving. He took this, and he took
that; he have been at it for weeks, ever since they&rsquo;d
had him. They thought it was the servant, and sent
her away. (A dirty young drab she was, so &rsquo;twere no
loss.) Not her, though; it were that beast of a magpie.
A whole nest of goods he had got hid away in
the brewhouse: but for having a brewing on, he
might never ha&rsquo; been found out. The woman was
drawing off her second mash when she see him hop in
with a new shirt wristban&rsquo; and drop it into the old
iron pot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod, who believed the story to be utterly unreasonable&mdash;got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
up, perhaps, by Mother Picker to screen the
real thief&mdash;resented the imputation on his magpie.
The bird came hopping up to us, &ldquo;Now, then,
Peter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather too good, Mrs. Picker, that is. I
have heard of lodging-house cats effecting wonders in
the way of domestic disappearances, but not of magpies.
Look at him, poor old fellow! He can&rsquo;t speak
to defend himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, look at him, sir,&rdquo; repeated Mother Picker;
&ldquo;and a fine objec&rsquo; of a half-fed animal he is, to look
at! My opinion is, he have got something wrong o&rsquo;
the inside of him, or else it&rsquo;s his sins that troubles his
skin, for the more he&rsquo;s give to eat the thinner he gets.
No feathers, no flesh; nothing but a big beak, and
them bright eyes, and the deuce&rsquo;s own tongue for
impedence. Which is begging pard&rsquo;n for speaking up
free,&rdquo; concluded Mother Picker, as Mrs. Todhetley came
in, fastening her waistband.</p>

<p>A little searching, not a tithe of what had been
before again and again, and the creature&rsquo;s nest was
discovered. In a cavity of the old tree-stump, so
conveniently opposite, lay the articles: the bank-note,
the ring, the blue bow, and some other things, most
of which had not been missed. One was a bank
receipt, that the house had been hunted for high and
low.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, then, Peter!&rdquo; cried the magpie, hopping
about on the gravel as he watched the raid on his
treasures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be killed to-day, Joe,&rdquo; said Mr. Todhetley;
&ldquo;he has made mischief enough. I never took
kindly to him. Monk, I am sorry for the mistake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
I was led into; but we suspected others before you&mdash;ay,
and accused them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, sir,&rdquo; replied Monk, his eye catching
mine. And if ever I saw revenge written in a
face, it was in his as he turned away.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>


<h2>ROGER MONK.</h2>


<p>I&rsquo;d never seen such a scene before; I have not seen
one since. Perhaps, in fact, the same thing had never
happened.</p>

<p>What had done it nobody could imagine. It was
as if the place had been smoked out with some
deleterious stuff; some destructive or poisoning gases,
fatal to vegetable life.</p>

<p>On the previous day but one, Tuesday, there had
been a party at the Manor. Squire and Mrs. Todhetley
did not go in for much of that kind of thing,
but some girls from London were staying with the
Jacobsons, and we all went over to a dance there on
the Friday. After supper some of them got talking
to Mrs. Todhetley, asking in a laughing sort of way
why <em>she</em> did not give them one? she shook her head,
and answered that we were quiet people. Upon that
Tod spoke up, and said he had no doubt the Squire
would give one if asked; would like to do it. Had
Mrs. Todhetley gone heartily into the proposal at
once, Tod would have thrown cold water on it. That
was his obstinacy. The girls attacked the Squire,
and the thing was settled; the dance being fixed for
the following Tuesday.</p>

<p>I know Mrs. Todhetley thought it an awful trouble;
the Squire openly said it was when we got home;
and he grumbled all day on Saturday. You see, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
servants were not used to fashionable parties; neither
in truth were their masters. However, if it had to be
done at all, it was to be done well. The laundry was
cleared out for dancing; the old square ironing-stove
taken away, and a few pictures were done round with
wreaths of green and hung on the yellow-washed
walls. The supper-table was laid in the dining-room;
leaving the drawing-room free for reception.</p>

<p>It was the Squire thought of having the plants
brought into the hall. He never could say afterwards
it was anybody but him. His grumbling was got over
by the Tuesday morning, and he was as eager as any
of us. He went about in his open nankeen coat and
straw hat, puffing and blowing, and saying he hoped we
should relish it&mdash;<em>he</em> wouldn&rsquo;t dance in the dog-days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to see you dance in any days now,
sir,&rdquo; cried Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You impudent rascals! You must laugh, too,
must you, Johnny! I can tell you young fellows
what&mdash;you&rsquo;ll neither of you dance a country dance as
we&rsquo;d used to do it. You should have seen us at the
wake. Once when we militia chaps were at the
Ram, at Gloucester, for a week&rsquo;s training, we gave a
ball there, and footed it till daylight. &lsquo;We bucks at
the Ram;&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what we called ourselves: but most
of us are dead and gone now. Look here, boys,&rdquo; continued
the pater after a pause, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the choice
plants brought into the hall. If we knock up a few
sconces for candles on the walls, their colours will
show out well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went out to talk to Roger Monk about it. Mrs.
Todhetley was in the kitchen over the creams and
jellies and things, fit to faint with heat. Jenkins, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
head-gardener was back then, but he was stiff yet,
not likely to be of permanent good; so Roger Monk
was kept on as chief. Under the pater&rsquo;s direction the
sets of green steps were brought in and put on either
side of the hall, as many sets as there was space for;
and the plants were arranged upon them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d tell you the different sorts but that you might
think it tedious. They were choice and beautiful.
Mr. Todhetley took pride in his flowers, and spared
no expense. Geraniums of all colours, tulips, brilliant
roses, the white lily and the purple iris; and the rarer
flowers, with hard names that nobody can spell. It
was like a lovely garden, rising tier upon tier; a
grove of perfume that the guests would pass through.
They managed the wax-lights well; and the colours,
pink, white, violet, green, orange, purple, scarlet, blue,
shone out as the old east window in Worcester
Cathedral used to do when it sparkled in the morning
sun.</p>

<p>It went off first-rate. Some of the supper sweet
dishes fell out of shape with the heat; but they were
just as good to eat. In London, the thing you call
&ldquo;society&rdquo; is made up of form and coldness, and artificialism;
with us county people it is honest openness.
There, any failure on the table is looked away
from, not supposed to be seen; at the supper at Squire
Todhetley&rsquo;s the tumble-down dishes were introduced
as a topic of regret. &ldquo;And to think it should be so,
after all the pains I bestowed on them!&rdquo; added Mrs.
Todhetley, not hesitating to say that she had been the
confectioner and pastry-cook.</p>

<p>But it is not of the party I have to tell you. It
was jolly; and everyone said what a prime ball-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the laundry made. I dare say if we had been London
fashionables we should have called it the &ldquo;library,&rdquo;
and made believe we&rsquo;d had the books taken out.</p>

<p>Getting ready for company is delightful; but putting
things to rights the next day is rather another thing.
The plants were carried back to their places again in
the greenhouse&mdash;a large, long, commodious greenhouse&mdash;and
appeared none the worse for their show.
The old folks, whose dancing-days were over, had
spent half the night in the cool hall, admiring these
beautiful plants; and the pater told this to Roger
Monk as he stood with him in the greenhouse after
they were put back. I was there, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they were admired, sir,&rdquo; said Monk in
answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken pains with them, and I think
they do the Manor credit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, truth to say, Monk, it&rsquo;s a better and brighter
collection than Jenkins ever got. But you must not
tell him I say so. I do take a pride in my greenhouse;
my father did before me. I remember your
mother spending a day here once, Johnny, before you
were born, and she said of all the collections in the
two counties of Warwick and Worcester, ours was
the finest. It came up to Lord Coventry&rsquo;s; not as
large, of course, but the plants in the same prime condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir: I&rsquo;ve seen the conservatories at Croome,&rdquo;
returned Monk, who generally went in for large
names.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The late Lord Coventry&mdash;Yes! Here! Who&rsquo;s
calling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod&rsquo;s voice outside, shouting for the Squire, caused
the break. He had got Mr. Duffham with him; who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
wanted to ask about some parish business; and they
came to the greenhouse.</p>

<p>So that made another admirer. Old Duff turned
himself and his cane about, saying the colours looked
brighter by daylight than waxlight; and he had not
thought it possible the night before that they could
do it. He stole a piece of geranium to put in his
button-hole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, Monk, when are you going over to
Evesham about those seeds and things?&rdquo; asked the
Squire, as he was departing with old Duff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can go when you like, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to-morrow, then. Start with the cool of the
morning. Jenkins can do what has to be done, for
once. You had better take the light cart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; answered Monk. But he had
never once looked in the Squire&rsquo;s face as he answered.</p>

<p>The next morning was Thursday. Tod and I were
up betimes to go fishing. There was a capital stream&mdash;but
I&rsquo;ve not time for that now. It was striking
six as we went out of the house, and the first thing
I saw was Jenkins coming along, his face as white
as a sheet. He was a big man once, of middle
height, but thin and stooping since his last bout of
rheumatism; grey whiskers, blue eyes, and close upon
fifty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Tod, look at old Jenkins! He must be ill
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not ill but frightened. His lips were of a bluey
grey, like one whom some great terror has scared.
Tod stared as he came nearer, for they were trembling
as well as blue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Jenkins?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what, Mr. Joe. The devil has been
at work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whereabouts?&rdquo; asked Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and see, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned back towards the greenhouse, but not
another word would he say, only pointed to it. Leaving
the fishing-rods on the path, we set off to run.</p>

<p>Never had I seen such a scene before; as I told you
at the beginning. The windows were shut, every
crevice where a breath of air might enter seemed to
be hermetically closed; a smell as of some sulphurous
acid pervaded the air; and the whole show of plants
had turned to ruin.</p>

<p>A wreck complete. Colour was gone; leaves and
stems were gone; the sweet perfume was gone;
nothing remained, so to say, but the pots. It was as
if some burning blast had passed through the greenhouse,
withering to death every plant that stood in it,
and the ripening grapes above.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth can have done this?&rdquo; cried Tod to
Jenkins, when he was able to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Joseph, I say nothing <em>could</em> have done
it but the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk rubbish about the devil, Jenkins. He
does not work in quite so practical a way. Open the
windows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was on by half-past five, sir, not coming here at
first, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Monk this morning?&rdquo; again interrupted
Tod, who had turned imperative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Squire sent him over to Evesham for the
seeds. I heard him go by in the light cart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sent him when?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yesterday, I suppose; that is, told him to go.
Monk came to me last evening and said I must be on
early. He started betimes; it was long afore five
when I heard the cart go by. I should know the
rattle of that there light cart anywhere, Mr. Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind the cart. What has done <em>this</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the question. What had done it? Some
blasting poison must have been set to burn in the
greenhouse. Such substances might be common
enough, but we knew nothing of them. We examined
the place pretty carefully, but not a trace of any
proof was discovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; cried out Jenkins, presently.</p>

<p>Some earthenware pot-stands were stacked on the
ground at the far end of the greenhouse&mdash;Mrs. Todhetley
always called them saucers&mdash;Jenkins had been
taking two or three of the top ones off, and came upon
one that contained a small portion of some soft, white,
damp substance, smelling just like the smell that
pervaded the greenhouse&mdash;a suffocating smell that
choked you. Some sulphuric acid was in the tool-house;
Tod fetched the bottle, poured a little on the
stuff, and set it alight.</p>

<p>Instantly a white smoke arose, and a smell that sent
us off. Jenkins, looking at it as if it were alive and
going to bite him, carried it at arm&rsquo;s length out to the
nearest bed, and heaped mould upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That has done it, Mr. Joseph. But I should like
to know what the white stuff is. It&rsquo;s some subtle
poison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We took the stack of pot-stands off one by one.
Six or eight of them were perfectly clean, as if just
wiped out. Jenkins gave his opinion again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Them clean saucers have all had the stuff burning
in &rsquo;em this night, and they&rsquo;ve done their work well.
Somebody, which it must be the villain himself, has
been in and cleaned &rsquo;em out, overlooking one of &rsquo;em.
I can be upon my word the stands were all dusty
enough last Tuesday, when the greenhouse was emptied
for the ball, for I stacked &rsquo;em myself one upon
another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod took up his perch on the edge of the shut-in
brick stove, and surveyed the wreck. There was not
a bit of green life remaining, not a semblance of it.
When he had done looking he stared at me, then at
Jenkins; it was his way when puzzled or perplexed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen anybody about here this morning,
Jenkins?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a soul,&rdquo; responded Jenkins, ruefully. &ldquo;I was
about the beds and places at first, and when I came
up here and opened the door, the smoke and smell
knocked me back&rsquo;ards. When I see the plants&mdash;leastways
what was the plants&mdash;with their leaves and
blossoms and stems all black and blasted, I says to
myself, &lsquo;The devil must have been in here;&rsquo; and I
was on my way to tell the master so when you two
young gents met me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s time some of them were about,&rdquo; cried Tod.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Drew? Is he not come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drew be hanged for a lazy vagabond!&rdquo; retorted
old Jenkins. &ldquo;He never comes on much afore seven,
he doesn&rsquo;t. Monk threatened last week to get his
wages stopped for him. I did stop &rsquo;em once, afore I
was ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drew was the under-gardener, an active young
fellow of nineteen. There was a boy as well, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
happened that he was away just now. Almost as
Jenkins spoke, Drew came in view, leaping along
furiously towards the vegetable garden, as though he
knew he was late.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halloa, Drew!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He recognized Tod&rsquo;s voice, turned, and came into
the greenhouse. His look of amazement would have
made a picture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sakes alive! Jenkins, what have done this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about it, Drew?&rdquo; asked
Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, sir?&rdquo; answered Drew, turning his wide-open
eyes on Tod, in surprise at the question. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t as
much as know what it <em>is</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Joe, I think the master ought to be told of
this,&rdquo; said Jenkins. &ldquo;As well get it over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He meant the explosion of wrath that was sure to
come when the Squire saw the ravages. Tod never
stirred. Who was to tell him? It was like the mice
proposing to bell the cat: nobody offered to do it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go, Johnny,&rdquo; said Tod, by-and-by. &ldquo;Perhaps
he&rsquo;s getting up now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went. I always did what he ordered me, and
heard Mrs. Todhetley in her dressing-room. She had
her white petticoats on, doing her hair. When I told
her, she just backed into a chair and turned as white
as Jenkins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Johnny?&rdquo; roared out the Squire from
his bed. I hadn&rsquo;t noticed that the door between the
rooms was open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something is wrong in the greenhouse, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something wrong in the greenhouse! What d&rsquo;ye
mean, lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He says the plants are spoiled, and the grapes,&rdquo;
interrupted Mrs. Todhetley, to help me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plants and grapes spoiled! You must be out of
your senses, Johnny, to say such a thing. What has
spoiled them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks like some&mdash;blight,&rdquo; I answered, pitching
upon the word. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s dead and blackened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Downstairs I rushed for fear he should ask more.
And down came the pater after me, hardly anything
on, so to say; not shaved, and his nankeen coat flying
behind him.</p>

<p>I let him go on to get the burst over. When I
reached them, they were talking about the key. It
was customary for the head-gardener to lock the
greenhouse at night. For the past month or so there
had been, as may be said, two head-gardeners, and the
key had been left on the ledge at the back of the
greenhouse, that whichever of them came on first in
the morning might get in.</p>

<p>The Squire stormed at this&mdash;with that scene before
his eyes he was ready to storm at everything. Pretty
gardeners, they were! leaving the key where any
tramp, hiding about the premises for a night&rsquo;s lodging,
might get into the greenhouse and steal what he
chose! As good leave the key in the door, as hang it
up outside it! The world had nothing but fools in it,
as he believed.</p>

<p>Jenkins answered with deprecation. The key was not
likely to be found by anybody but those that knew where
to look for it. It always had a flower-pot turned down
upon it; and so he had found it that morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If all the tramps within ten miles got into the
greenhouse, sir, they&rsquo;d not do this,&rdquo; affirmed Tod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; said the Squire; &ldquo;what do you
know about tramps? I&rsquo;ve known them to do the
wickedest things conceivable. My beautiful plants!
And look at the grapes! I&rsquo;ve never had a finer crop
of grapes than this was, Jenkins,&rdquo; concluded the pater,
in a culminating access of rage. &ldquo;If I find this has
arisen through any neglect of yours and Monk&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
hang you both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The morning went on; breakfast was over, and the
news of the strange calamity spread. Old Jones,
the constable, had been sent for by the Squire. He
stared, and exclaimed, and made his comments; but
he was not any the nearer hitting upon the guilty
man.</p>

<p>About ten, Roger Monk got home from Evesham.
We heard the spring-cart go round to the stables, and
presently he appeared in the gardens, looking at
objects on either side of the path, as was his usual
wont. Then he caught sight of us, standing in and
about the greenhouse, and came on faster. Jenkins
was telling the story of his discovery to Mr. Duffham.
He had told it a good fifty times since early morning
to as many different listeners.</p>

<p>They made way for Monk to come in, nobody
saying a word. The pater stood inside, and Monk,
touching his hat, was about to report to him of his
journey, when the strange aspect of affairs seemed to
strike him dumb. He looked round with a sort of
startled gaze at the walls, at the glass and grapes
above, at the destroyed plants, and then turned
savagely on Jenkins, speaking hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you been up to here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Me</em> been up to! That&rsquo;s good, that is! What had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
<em>you</em>, been up to afore you went off? You had the
first chance. Come, Mr. Monk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The semi-accusation was spoken by Jenkins on the
spur of the moment, in his anger at the other&rsquo;s words.
Monk was in a degree Jenkins&rsquo;s protégé, and it had
not previously occurred to him that <em>he</em> could be in
any way to blame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you know of this wicked business,
Monk?&rdquo; asked the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should I know of it, sir? I have only just
come in from Evesham. The things were all right
last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you leave the greenhouse last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly as I always leave it, sir. There was
nothing the matter with it then. Drew&mdash;I saw him
outside, didn&rsquo;t I? Step here, Drew. You were with
me when I locked up the greenhouse last night. Did
you see anything wrong with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It were right enough then,&rdquo; answered Drew.</p>

<p>Monk turned himself about, lifting his hands in
dismay, as one blackened object after another came
under view. &ldquo;I never saw such a thing!&rdquo; he cried
piteously. &ldquo;There has been something wrong at
work here; or else&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monk came to a sudden pause. &ldquo;Or else what?&rdquo;
asked the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or else, moving the plants into the hall on Tuesday
has killed them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moving the plants wouldn&rsquo;t kill them. What are
you thinking of, Monk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Moving</em> them would not kill them, sir, or hurt them
either,&rdquo; returned Monk, with a stress on the first word;
&ldquo;but it might have been the remote cause of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw some result of the sort once, sir. It was at
a gentleman&rsquo;s place at Chiswick. All the choice plants
were taken indoors to improvise a kind of conservatory
for a night fête. They were carried back the next
day, seemingly none the worse, and on the morrow
were found withered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like these?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, not so bad as these. They didn&rsquo;t die;
they revived after a time. A great fuss was made
over it; the gentleman thought it must be wilful
damage, and offered twenty pounds reward for the
discovery of the offenders. At last it was found they
had been poisoned by the candles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poisoned by the candles!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A new sort of candle, very beautiful to look at, but
with a great quantity of arsenic in it,&rdquo; continued Monk.
&ldquo;A scientific man gave it as his opinion that the poison
thrown out from the candles had been fatal to the plants.
Perhaps something of the same kind has done the mischief
here, sir. Plants are such delicate things!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what has been fatal to the grapes? <em>They</em>
were not taken into the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question came from the surgeon, Mr. Duffham.
He had stood all the while against the end of the far
steps, looking fixedly at Monk over the top of his
cane. Monk put his eyes on the grapes above, and
kept them there while he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, sir; the grapes, as you say, didn&rsquo;t go in.
Perhaps the poison brought back by the plants may
have acted on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I tell you what, Monk, I think that&rsquo;s all
nonsense,&rdquo; cried the Squire, testily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I don&rsquo;t see any other way of accounting
for this state of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The greenhouse was filled with some suffocating,
smelling, blasting stuff that knocked me back&rsquo;ards,&rdquo;
put in Jenkins. &ldquo;Every crack and crevice was stopped
where a breath of air could have got in. I wish it
had been you to find it; you&rsquo;d not have liked to be
smothered alive, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish it had been,&rdquo; said Monk. &ldquo;If there was
any such thing here, and not your fancy, I&rsquo;ll be bound
I&rsquo;d have traced it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, would you! Did you do anything to them
there pot-stands?&rdquo; continued Jenkins, pointing to
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Didn&rsquo;t clean &rsquo;em out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wiped a few out on Wednesday morning before
we brought back the plants. Somebody&mdash;Drew, I
suppose&mdash;had stacked them in the wrong place. In
putting them right, I began to wipe them. I didn&rsquo;t
do them all; I was called away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas me stacked &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Jenkins. &ldquo;Well&mdash;them
stands are what had held the poison; I found
a&rsquo;most one-half of &rsquo;em filled with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monk cast a rapid glance around. &ldquo;What was the
poison?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Jenkins grunted, but gave no other reply. The
fact was, he had been so abused by the Squire for
having put away the trace of the &ldquo;stuff,&rdquo; that it was
a sore subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you come on here, Monk, before you started
for Evesham this morning?&rdquo; questioned the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come near the gardens, sir. I had told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Jenkins last night to be on early,&rdquo; replied Monk,
bending over a blackened row of plants while he
spoke. &ldquo;I went the back way to the stables through
the lane, had harnessed the horse to the cart, and was
away before five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We quitted the greenhouse. The pater went out
with Mr. Duffham, Tod and I followed. I, looking
quietly on, had been struck with the contrast of
manner between old Duff and Monk&mdash;he peering at
Monk with his searching gaze, never once taking it
off him; and Monk meeting nobody&rsquo;s eyes, but shifting
his own anywhere rather than meet them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About this queer arsenic tale Monk tells?&rdquo; began
the Squire. &ldquo;Is there anything in it? Will it hold
water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moonshine!&rdquo; said old Duff, with emphasis.</p>

<p>The tone was curious, and we all looked at him.
He had got his lips drawn in, and the top of his cane
pressing them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you take Monk from, Squire? Get
a good character with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jenkins brought him here. As to character, he
had never been in any situation before. Why? Do
you suspect him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um-m-m!&rdquo; said the doctor, prolonging the sound
as though in doubt. &ldquo;If I do suspect him, he has
caused me to. I never saw such a shifty manner in
all my life. Why, he never once looked at any of us!
His eyes are false, and his tones are false!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His tones? Do you mean his words?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean the tone his words are spoken in. To an
apt ear, the sound of a man&rsquo;s voice, or woman&rsquo;s either,
can be read off like a book; a man&rsquo;s voice is honest or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
dishonest according to his nature; and you can&rsquo;t
make a mistake about it. Monk&rsquo;s has a false ring in
it, if ever I heard one. Now, master Johnny, what
are you looking so eager about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Monk&rsquo;s voice false, too, Mr. Duffham; I
have thought himself false all along. Tod knows I
have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that you are just a muff, Johnny, going in
for prejudices against people unreasonably,&rdquo; said Tod,
putting me down as usual.</p>

<p>Old Duff pushed my straw hat up, and passed his
fingers over the top of my forehead. &ldquo;Johnny, my
boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have a strong and good indication
here for reading the world. <em>Trust to it.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t trust Monk. I never have trusted him.
That was one reason why I suspected him of stealing
the things the magpie took.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you were wrong there,&rdquo; said Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But I&rsquo;m nearly sure I was right in the thing
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What thing?&rdquo; demanded old Duff, sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought it was Monk that frightened
Ph&oelig;be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mr. Duffham. &ldquo;Dressed himself up in
a sheet, and whitened his face, and went up the
lane when the women were watching for the shadows
on St. Mark&rsquo;s Eve! What else do you suspect,
Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing else, sir; except that I fancied Mother
Picker knew of it. When Tod and I went to ask
her whether Monk was out that night, she looked
frightened to death, and broke a basin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she say he was out?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She said he was not out; but I thought she said
it more eagerly than truthfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Squire, when you are in doubt as to people&rsquo;s
morals, let this boy read them for you,&rdquo; said old Duff,
in his quaint way. The Squire, thinking of his plants,
looked as perplexed as could be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is such a thing, you know, Duffham, to have
one&rsquo;s whole hothouse destroyed in a night. It&rsquo;s no
better than arson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the incendiary who did it would have no
scruple in attacking the barns next; therefore, he
must be bowled out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pater looked rueful. He could bluster and
threaten, but he could not <em>do</em> much; he never knew
how to set about it. In all emergencies he would
send for Jones&mdash;the greatest old woman going.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seriously think it could have been
Monk, Duffham?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s strong suspicion that it was. Look
here:&rdquo; and the doctor began to tell off points with his
cane and fingers. &ldquo;<em>Somebody</em> goes into the greenhouse
to set the stuff alight in the pot-stands&mdash;for
that&rsquo;s how it was done. Monk and Jenkins alone
knew where the key was; Jenkins, a trusty man,
years in the employ, comes on at six and finds the
state of things. Where&rsquo;s Monk? Gone off by previous
order to Evesham at five. Why should it happen the
very morning he was away? What was to prevent
his stealing into the greenhouse after dark last night
putting his deleterious stuff to work, leaving it to
burn, and stealing in again at four this morning to
put all traces away? He thought he cleaned out all
the tale-telling earthen saucers, but he overlooks one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
as is usually the case. When he comes back, finding
the wreck and the commotion consequent upon it, he
relates a glib tale of other plants destroyed by arsenic
from candles, and he never looks honestly into a single
face as he tells it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire drew a deep breath. &ldquo;And you say
Monk did all this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Squire. I say he might have done it.
I say, moreover, that it looks very like it. Putting
Monk aside, your scent would be wholly at fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see Mother Picker; she can tell what
time he went in last night, and what time he came
out this morning,&rdquo; cried Tod, who was just as hasty
as the pater. But old Duff caught him as he was
vaulting off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> had better see Mother Picker. Will you let me
act in this matter, Squire, and see what can be made
of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do, Duffham. Take Jones to help you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jones be shot,&rdquo; returned Duff in a passion. &ldquo;If I
wanted any one&mdash;which I <em>don&rsquo;t</em>&mdash;I&rsquo;d take Johnny.
He is worth fifty Joneses. <em>Say nothing</em>&mdash;nothing at
all. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went off down a side path, and crossed Jenkins,
who was at work now. Monk stayed in the greenhouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a sad calamity, Jenkins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the worst <em>I</em> ever met with, sir,&rdquo; cried Jenkins,
touching his hat. &ldquo;And what have done it is the odd
thing. Monk, he talks of the candles poisoning of
&rsquo;em; but I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s not a much surer poison than arsenic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Jenkins,&rdquo; said the doctor, candidly. &ldquo;I hope it will be
cleared up. Monk, too, has taken so much pains with
the plants. He is a clever young man in his vocation.
Where did you hear of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jenkins&rsquo;s answer was a long one. Curtailed, it
stated that he had heard of Monk &ldquo;promiskeous.&rdquo;
He had thought him a gentleman till he asked if he,
Jenkins, could help him to a place as ornamental
gardener. He had rather took to the young man, and
recommended the Squire to employ him &ldquo;temporay,&rdquo;
for he, Jenkins, was just then falling sick with
rheumatism.</p>

<p>Mr. Duffham nodded approvingly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t think
it necessary to ask for references?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monk said he could give me a cart-load a&rsquo;most of
them, sir, if I&rsquo;d wanted to see &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so! Good-day, Jenkins, I can&rsquo;t stay gossiping
my morning away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went straight to Mrs. Picker&rsquo;s, and caught her
taking her luncheon off the kitchen-table&mdash;bread-and-cheese,
and perry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little cask o&rsquo; last year&rsquo;s my son have made me
a present of, sir; if you&rsquo;d be pleased to drink a cup,
Dr. Duff&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said she, hospitably.</p>

<p>She drew a half-pint cup full; bright, sparkling,
full-bodied perry, never better made in Gloucestershire.
Mr. Duffham smacked his lips, and wished some of the
champagne at gentlemen&rsquo;s tables was half as good.
He talked, and she talked; and, it may be, he took
her a little off her guard. Evidently, she was not
cognizant of the mishap to the greenhouse.</p>

<p>A nice young man that lodger of hers? Well, yes,
he was; steady and well-conducted. Talked quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
like a gentleman, but wasn&rsquo;t uppish &rsquo;cause o&rsquo; that, and
seemed satisfied with all she did for him. He was
gone off to Evesham after seeds and other things.
Squire Todhetley put great confidence in him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Mr. Duffham, &ldquo;to be sure. One does
put confidence in steady young men, you know, Goody.
He was off by four o&rsquo;clock, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Earlier nor that, Goody Picker thought. Monk
were one o&rsquo; them who liked to take time by the forelock,
and get his extra work forrard when he were
put on to any.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing like putting the shoulder to the wheel.
This <em>is</em> perry! The next time I call to see your son
Peter, at Alcester, I shall ask him if he can&rsquo;t get some
for me. As to Monk&mdash;you might have had young
fellows here who&rsquo;d have idled their days away, and
paid no rent, Goody. Monk was at his work late last
night, too, I fancy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Goody fancied he had been; leastways he went out
after supper, and were gone an hour or so. What with
the fires, and what with the opening and shutting o&rsquo;
the winders to keep the hot-houses at proper temperture,
an head-gardener didn&rsquo;t sit on a bed o&rsquo; idle roses,
as Dr. Duff&rsquo;m knew.</p>

<p>Mr. Duffham was beginning to make pretty sure of
winning his game. His manner suddenly changed.
Pushing the empty cup from him, he leaned forward,
and laid hold of Mrs. Picker by the two wrists.
Between the perry and the doctor&rsquo;s sociability and
Monk&rsquo;s merits, her eyes had begun to sparkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, Mrs. Picker. I have come here
to ask you a question, <em>and you must answer me</em>. But
you have nothing to fear on your own score, provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
you tell me the truth honestly. Young men will do
foolish things, however industrious they may be. Why
did Monk play that prank on Easter Monday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sparkle in the eyes faded with fright. She
would have got away, but could not, and so put on an
air of wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Easter Monday! What were it he did on
Easter Monday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he put himself and his face into white, and
went to the churchyard by moonlight to represent the
dead, you know, Mrs. Picker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave a shrill scream, got one of her hands loose
and flung it up to her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Goody, you had better answer me quietly
than be taken to confess before Squire Todhetley. I
dare say you were not to blame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Afore Squire Todhetley! O-o-o-o-o-h! Did they
know it at the Manor?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Duffham, &ldquo;you see I know it, and
I have come straight from there. Now then, my
good woman, I have not much time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Goody Picker&rsquo;s will was good to hold out longer, but
she surrendered à coup de main, as so many of us have
to do when superior power is brought to bear. Monk
overheered it, was the substance of her answer. On
coming in from work that there same blessed evening&mdash;and
look at him now! at his work on a Easter
Monday till past dark!&mdash;he overheered the two
servants, Molly and Hannah, talking of what they was
going out to watch for&mdash;the shadows in the churchyard.
He let &rsquo;em go, never showing hisself till they&rsquo;d
left the house. Then he got the sheets from his bed,
and put the flour on his face, and went on there to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
frighten &rsquo;em; all in fun. He never thought of hurting
the women; he never knowed as the young girl, Ph&oelig;be,
was to be there. Nobody could be more sorry for it
nor he was; but he&rsquo;d never meant to do harm more
nor a babby unborn.</p>

<p>Mr. Duffham released the hands. Looking back in
reflection, he had little doubt it was as she said&mdash;that
Monk had done it out of pure sport, not intending ill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might have confessed: it would have been
more honest. And you! why did you deny that it
was Monk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Picker at first could only stare in reply. Confess
to it? Him? What, and run the risk o&rsquo; being
put into ancuffs by that there Jones with his fat legs?
And she! a poor old widder? If Monk went and
said he didn&rsquo;t do it, she couldn&rsquo;t go and say he <em>did</em>.
Doctor Duff&rsquo;m might see as there were no choice left
for <em>her</em>. Never should she forget the fright when the
two young gents come in with their querries the next
day; her fingers was took with the palsy and dropped
the pudd&rsquo;n basin, as she&rsquo;d had fifteen year. Monk,
poor fellow, couldn&rsquo;t sleep for a peck o&rsquo; nights after,
thinking o&rsquo; Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There; that&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Mr. Duffham. &ldquo;Who
is Monk? Where does he come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the moon, for all Mrs. Picker knew. A civiler
young man she&rsquo;d not wish to have lodging with her;
paid reg&rsquo;lar as the Saturdays come round; but he
never told her nothing about hisself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is his room? The one at the back, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without saying with your leave, or by your leave,
as Mrs. Picker phrased it in telling the story a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
while afterwards, Mr. Duffham penetrated at once
into the lodger&rsquo;s room. There he took the liberty of
making a slight examination, good Mrs. Picker standing
by with round eyes and open mouth. And what
he discovered caused him to stride off at once to the
pater.</p>

<p>Roger Monk was not Monk at all, but somebody
else. He had been implicated in some crime (whether
guilty or not remained yet a question), and to avoid
exposure had come away into this quiet locality under
a false name. In short, during the time he had been
working as gardener at Dyke Manor and living at
Mother Picker&rsquo;s, he was in hiding. As the son of
a well-known and most respectable landscape and
ornamental nursery-man, he had become thoroughly
conversant with the requisite duties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are fools, at the best, these fellows,&rdquo; remarked
Duffham, as he finished his narrative. &ldquo;A letter
written to him by some friend betrayed to me all this.
Now why should not Monk have destroyed that
letter, instead of keeping it in his room, Squire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire did not answer. All he could do just
now was to wipe his hot face and try to get over
his amazement. Monk not a gardener or servant at
all, but an educated man! Only living there to
hide from the police; and calling himself by any
name that came uppermost&mdash;which happened to be
Monk!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must say there&rsquo;s a certain credit due to him for
his patient industry, and the perfection to which he
has brought your grounds,&rdquo; said Mr. Duffham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for blighting all my hot-house plants at a
blow&mdash;is there credit due to him for that?&rdquo; roared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
out the Squire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have him tried for it, as sure as
my name&rsquo;s Todhetley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was easier said than done. For when Mr. Jones,
receiving his private orders from the pater, went, staff
in hand, to arrest Monk, that gentleman had already
departed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He come into the house just as Dr. Duff&rsquo;m left
it,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Picker. &ldquo;Saying he had got to
take a short journey, he put his things into his port-manty,
and went off carrying of it, leaving me a
week&rsquo;s rent on the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go and catch him, Jones,&rdquo; sternly commanded the
Squire, when the constable came back with the above
news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, your worship,&rdquo; replied Jones. But how he
was to do it, taking the gouty legs into consideration,
was quite a different thing.</p>

<p>The men were sent off various ways. And came
back again, not having come up with Monk. Squire
Todhetley went into a rage, abused old Jones, and told
him he was no longer worth his salt. But the strangest
thing occurred in the evening.</p>

<p>The pater walked over to the Court after tea, carrying
the grievance of his destroyed plants to the
Sterlings. In coming up Dyke Lane as he returned
at night, where it was always darker than in other
places because the trees hid the moonlight, somebody
seemed to walk right out of the hedge upon him.</p>

<p>It was Roger Monk. He raised his hat to the
Squire as a gentleman does&mdash;did not touch it as a
gardener&mdash;and began pleading for clemency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clemency, after destroying a whole hot-houseful
of rare plants!&rdquo; cried the Squire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I never did it, sir,&rdquo; returned Monk, passionately.
&ldquo;On my word as a man&mdash;I will not to you say as
a gentleman&mdash;if the plants were not injured by the
candles, as I fully believe, I know not how they could
have been injured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pater was staggered. At heart he was the best
man living. Suppose Monk <em>was</em> innocent?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Monk. You know your name is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, sir!&rdquo; interposed Monk, hastily, as if to
prevent the hedges hearing the true name. &ldquo;It is of
that I have waited to speak to you; to beseech your
clemency. I have no need to crave it in the matter
of plants which I never harmed. I want to ask you
to be silent, sir; not to proclaim to the world that
I am other than what I appeared to be. A short
while longer and I should have been able to prove
my innocence; things are working round. But if you
set the hue-and-cry upon me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you innocent?&rdquo; interposed the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was; I swear it to you. Oh, Mr. Todhetley,
think for a moment! I am not so very much older
than your son; he is not more innocent than I was;
but it might happen that he&mdash;I crave your pardon,
sir, but it <em>might</em>&mdash;that he should become the companion
of dissipated young men, and get mixed up
unwittingly in a disgraceful affair, whose circumstances
were so complicated that he could only fly for a time
and hide himself. What would you say if the people
with whom he took refuge, whether as servant or else,
were to deliver him up to justice, and he stood before
the world an accused felon? Sir, it is my case. Keep
my secret; keep my secret, Mr. Todhetley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And couldn&rsquo;t you prove your innocence?&rdquo; cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the Squire, as he followed out the train of ideas
suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at present&mdash;that I see. And when once a
man has stood at a criminal bar, it is a ban on him for
life, although it may be afterwards shown he stood
there wrongly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the Squire, softening.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;for there&rsquo;s no space to go on at length&mdash;the
upshot was that Monk went away with a promise;
and the Squire came home to the Manor and told
Duffham, who was waiting there, that they must both
be silent. Only those two knew of the discovery;
they had kept the particulars and Monk&rsquo;s real name
to themselves. Duff gave his head a toss, and told
the pater he was softer than old Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How came <em>you</em> to suspect him, Johnny?&rdquo; he continued,
turning on me in his sharp way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think just for the same things that you did, Mr.
Duffham&mdash;because neither his face nor his voice is
<em>true</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And&mdash;remembering his look of revenge when accused
in mistake for the magpie&mdash;I suspected him still.</p>

<h2>THE EBONY BOX.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>In one or two of the papers already written for you,
I have spoken of &ldquo;Lawyer Cockermuth,&rdquo; as he was
usually styled by his fellow-townspeople at Worcester.
I am now going to tell of something that happened in
his family; that actually did happen, and is no invention
of mine.</p>

<p>Lawyer Cockermuth&rsquo;s house stood in the Foregate
Street. He had practised in it for a good many
years; he had never married, and his sister lived with
him. She had been christened Betty; it was a more
common name in those days than it is in these. There
was a younger brother named Charles. They were
tall, wiry men with long arms and legs. John, the
lawyer, had a smiling, homely face; Charles was handsome,
but given to be choleric.</p>

<p>Charles had served in the militia once, and had
been ever since called Captain Cockermuth. When
only twenty-one he married a young lady with a good
bit of money; he had also a small income of his own;
so he abandoned the law, to which he had been bred,
and lived as a gentleman in a pretty little house on
the outskirts of Worcester. His wife died in the
course of a few years, leaving him with one child, a
son, named Philip. The interest of Mrs. Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Cockermuth&rsquo;s money would be enjoyed by her husband
until his death, and then would go to Philip.</p>

<p>When Philip left school he was articled to his uncle,
Lawyer Cockermuth, and took up his abode with him.
Captain Cockermuth (who was of a restless disposition,
and fond of roving), gave up his house then and went
travelling about. Philip Cockermuth was a very nice
steady young fellow, and his father was liberal to him
in the way of pocket-money, allowing him a guinea
a-week. Every Monday morning Lawyer Cockermuth
handed (for his brother) to Philip a guinea in gold;
the coin being in use then. Philip spent most of this
in books, but he saved some of it; and by the time
he was of age he had sixty golden guineas put aside
in a small round black box of carved ebony. &ldquo;What
are you going to do with it, Philip?&rdquo; asked Miss
Cockermuth, as he brought it down from his room to
show her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what yet, Aunt Betty,&rdquo;
said Philip, laughing. &ldquo;I call it my nest-egg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He carried the little black box (the sixty guineas
quite filled it), back to his chamber and put it back
into one of the pigeon-holes of the old-fashioned bureau
which stood in the room, where he always kept it,
and left it there, the bureau locked as usual. After
that time, Philip put his spare money, now increased
by a salary, into the Old Bank; and it chanced that
he did not again look at the ebony box of gold, never
supposing but that it was safe in its hiding-place. On
the occasion of his marriage some years later, he
laughingly remarked to Aunt Betty that he must now
take his box of guineas into use; and he went up to
fetch it. The box was not there.</p>

<p>Consternation ensued. The family flocked upstairs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the lawyer, Miss Betty, and the captain&mdash;who had
come to Worcester for the wedding, and was staying
in the house&mdash;one and all put their hands into the
deep, dark pigeon-holes, but failed to find the box.
The captain, a hot-tempered man, flew into a passion
and swore over it; Miss Betty shed tears; Lawyer
Cockermuth, always cool and genial, shrugged his
shoulders and absolutely joked. None of them could
form the slightest notion as to how the box had gone
or who was likely to have taken it, and it had to be
given up as a bad job.</p>

<p>Philip was married the next day, and left his
uncle&rsquo;s house for good, having taken one out Barbourne
way. Captain Cockermuth felt very sore about the
loss of the box, he strode about Worcester talking of
it, and swearing that he would send the thief to
Botany Bay if he could find him.</p>

<p>A few years more yet, and poor Philip became ill.
Ill of the disorder which had carried off his mother&mdash;decline.
When Captain Cockermuth heard that his
son was lying sick, he being (as usual) on his travels,
he hastened to Worcester and took up his abode at
his brother&rsquo;s&mdash;always his home on these visits. The
disease was making very quick progress indeed; it
was what is called &ldquo;rapid decline.&rdquo; The captain
called in all the famed doctors of the town&mdash;if they
had not been called before: but there was no hope.</p>

<p>The day before Philip died, his father spoke to him
about the box of guineas. It had always seemed to
the captain that Philip must have, or ought to have,
<em>some</em> notion of how it went. And he put the question
to him again, solemnly, for the last time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said the dying man&mdash;who retained all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
faculties and his speech to the very end&mdash;&ldquo;I declare
to you that I have none. I have never been able to
set up any idea at all upon the loss, or attach suspicion
to a soul, living or dead. The two maids were honest;
they would not have touched it; the clerks had no
opportunity of going upstairs. I had always kept the
key safely, and you know that we found the lock of
the bureau had not been tampered with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Philip died. His widow and four children
went to live at a pretty cottage on Malvern Link&mdash;upon
a hundred pounds a-year, supplied to her by her
father-in-law. Mr. Cockermuth added the best part
of another hundred. These matters settled, Captain
Cockermuth set off on his rovings again, considering
himself hardly used by Fate at having his limited
income docked of nearly half its value. And yet
some more years passed on.</p>

<p>This much has been by way of introduction to what
has to come. It was best to give it.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Jacobson, our neighbours at Dyke
Manor, had a whole colony of nephews, what with
brothers&rsquo; sons and sisters&rsquo; sons; of nieces also; batches
of them would come over in relays to stay at Elm
Farm, which had no children of its own. Samson
Dene was the favourite nephew of all; his mother
was sister to Mr. Jacobson, his father was dead.
Samson Reginald Dene he was christened, but most
people called him &ldquo;Sam.&rdquo; He had been articled to
the gentleman who took to his father&rsquo;s practice; a
lawyer in a village in Oxfordshire. Later, he had
gone to a firm in London for a year, had passed, and
then came down to his uncle at Elm Farm, asking
what he was to do next. For, upon his brother-in-law&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
death, Mr. Jacobson had taken upon himself the
expenses of Sam, the eldest son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want to know what you are to do now, eh?&rdquo; cried
old Jacobson, who was smoking his evening pipe by
the wide fire of the dark-wainscoted, handsome
dining-parlour, one evening in February. He was a
tall, portly man with a fresh-coloured, healthy face;
and not, I dare say, far off sixty years old. &ldquo;What
would you like to do?&mdash;what is your own opinion
upon it, Sam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to set up in practice for myself,
uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed! In what quarter of the globe, pray?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Worcester. I have always wished to practise
at Worcester. It is the assize town: I don&rsquo;t care for
pettifogging places: one can&rsquo;t get on in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d like to emerge all at once into a full-blown
lawyer there? That&rsquo;s your notion, is it, Sam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam made no answer. He knew by the tone his
notion was being laughed at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my lad. When you have been in some good
office for another year or two maybe, then you might
think about setting-up. The office can be in Worcester
if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am hard upon twenty-three, Uncle Jacobson. I
have as much knowledge of law as I need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as much steadiness also, perhaps?&rdquo; said old
Jacobson.</p>

<p>Sam turned as red as the table-cover. He was a
frank-looking, slender young fellow of middle height,
with fine wavy hair almost a gold colour and worn
of a decent length. The present fashion&mdash;to be
cropped as if you were a prison-bird and to pretend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
to like it so&mdash;was not favoured by gentlemen in those
days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may have been acquiring a knowledge of law
in London, Sam; I hope you have; but you&rsquo;ve been
kicking up your heels over it. What about those
sums of money you&rsquo;ve more than once got out of your
mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam&rsquo;s face was a deeper red than the cloth now.
&ldquo;Did she tell you of it, uncle?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t; she cares too much for her graceless
son to betray him. I chanced to hear of it,
though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One has to spend so much in London,&rdquo; murmured
Sam, in lame apology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say! In my past days, sir, a young man
had to cut his coat according to his cloth. We didn&rsquo;t
rush into all kinds of random games and then go to
our fathers or mothers to help us out of them. Which
is what you&rsquo;ve been doing, my gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does aunt know?&rdquo; burst out Sam in a fright, as
a step was heard on the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not told her,&rdquo; said Mr. Jacobson, listening&mdash;&ldquo;she
is gone on into the kitchen. How much is it
that you&rsquo;ve left owing in London, Sam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam nearly choked. He did not perceive this was
just a random shot: he was wondering whether magic
had been at work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Left owing in London?&rdquo; stammered he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I asked. How much? And I mean
to know. &rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t be of any use your fencing about
the bush. Come! tell it in a lump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifty pounds would cover it all, sir,&rdquo; said Sam,
driven by desperation into the avowal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I want the truth, Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the truth, uncle, I put it all down in a list
before leaving London; it comes to just under fifty
pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could you be so wicked as to contract it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has not been much wickedness about it,&rdquo;
said Sam, miserably, &ldquo;indeed there hasn&rsquo;t. One gets
drawn into expenses unconsciously in the most extraordinary
manner up in London. Uncle Jacobson, you
may believe me or not, when I say that until I added
it up, I did not think it amounted to twenty pounds
in all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then you found it to be fifty! How do you
propose to pay this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend to send it up by instalments, as I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Instead of doing which, you&rsquo;ll get into deeper debt
at Worcester. If it&rsquo;s Worcester you go to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not, uncle. I shall do my best to keep out
of debt. I mean to be steady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Jacobson filled a fresh pipe, and lighted it
with a spill from the mantelpiece. He did not doubt
the young fellow&rsquo;s intentions; he only doubted his
resolution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall go into some lawyer&rsquo;s office in Worcester
for two years, Sam, when we shall see how things turn
out,&rdquo; said he presently. &ldquo;And, look here, I&rsquo;ll pay
these debts of yours myself, provided you promise me
not to get into trouble again. There, no more&rdquo;&mdash;interrupting
Sam&rsquo;s grateful looks&mdash;&ldquo;your aunt&rsquo;s coming in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam opened the door for Mrs. Jacobson. A little
pleasant-faced woman in a white net cap, with small
flat silver curls under it. She carried a small basket
lined with blue silk, in which lay her knitting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking to your room, my dear, to see
that all&rsquo;s comfortable for you,&rdquo; she said to Sam, as she
sat down by the table and the candles. &ldquo;That new
housemaid of ours is not altogether to be trusted. I
suppose you&rsquo;ve been telling your uncle all about the
wonders of London?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And something else, too,&rdquo; put in old Jacobson
gruffly. &ldquo;He wanted to set up in practice for himself
at Worcester: off-hand, red-hot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; said Mrs. Jacobson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the boy wanted, nothing less. No.
Another year or two&rsquo;s work in some good house, to
acquire stability and experience, and then he may talk
about setting up. It will be all for the best, Sam;
trust me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, uncle, perhaps it will.&rdquo; It was of no use
for him to say perhaps it won&rsquo;t: he could not help
himself. But it was a disappointment.</p>

<p>Mr. Jacobson walked over to Dyke Manor the next
day, to consult the Squire as to the best lawyer to
place Sam with, himself suggesting their old friend
Cockermuth. He described all Sam&rsquo;s wild ways (it
was how he put it) in that dreadful place, London,
and the money he had got out of amidst its snares.
The Squire took up the matter with his usual hearty
sympathy, and quite agreed that no practitioner in the
law could be so good for Sam as John Cockermuth.</p>

<p>John Cockermuth proved to be agreeable. He was
getting to be an elderly man then, but was active as
ever, saving when a fit of the gout took him. He
received young Dene in his usual cheery manner, upon
the day appointed for his entrance, and assigned him
his place in the office next to Mr. Parslet. Parslet had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
been there more than twenty years; he was, so to say,
at the top and tail of all the work that went on in it,
but he was not a qualified solicitor. Samson Dene
was qualified, and could therefore represent Mr.
Cockermuth before the magistrates and what not: of
which the old lawyer expected to find the benefit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to live?&rdquo; he questioned of
Sam that first morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet, sir. Mr. and Mrs. Jacobson are
about the town now, I believe, looking for lodgings
for me. Of course they couldn&rsquo;t let <em>me</em> look; they&rsquo;d
think I should be taken in,&rdquo; added Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taken in and done for,&rdquo; laughed the lawyer. &ldquo;I
should not wonder but Mr. Parslet could accommodate
you. Can you, Parslet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Parslet looked up from his desk, his thin cheeks
flushing. He was small and slight, with weak brown
hair, and had a patient, sad sort of look in his face
and in his meek, dark eyes.</p>

<p>James Parslet was one of those men who are said to
spoil their own lives. Left alone early, he was looked
after by a bachelor uncle, a minor canon of the cathedral,
who perhaps tried to do his duty by him in a
mild sort of manner. But young Parslet liked to go
his own ways, and they were not very good ways. He
did not stay at any calling he was put to, trying first
one and then another; either the people got tired of
him, or he of them. Money (when he got any) burnt
a hole in his pocket, and his coats grew shabby and his
boots dirty. &ldquo;Poor Jamie Parslet! how he has spoilt
his life&rdquo; cried the town, shaking its pitying head at
him: and thus things went on till he grew to be
nearly thirty years of age. Then, to the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
astonishment, Jamie pulled up. He got taken on by
Lawyer Cockermuth as copying clerk at twenty
shillings a-week, married, and became as steady as
Old Time. He had been nothing but steady from that
day to this, had forty shillings a-week now, instead of
twenty, and was ever a meek, subdued man, as if he
carried about with him a perpetual repentance for the
past, regret for the life that might have been. He
lived in Edgar Street, which is close to the cathedral,
as every one knows, Edgar Tower being at the top of
it. An old gentleman attached to the cathedral had
now lodged in his house for ten years, occupying the
drawing-room floor; he had recently died, and hence
Lawyer Cockermuth&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>

<p>Mr. Parslet looked up. &ldquo;I should be happy to, sir,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;if our rooms suited Mr. Dene. Perhaps he
would like to look at them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;If my uncle and aunt do not
fix on any for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is there any subtle mesmeric power, I wonder, that
influences things unconsciously? Curious to say, at
this very moment Mr. and Mrs. Jacobson were looking
at these identical rooms. They had driven into
Worcester with Sam very early indeed, so as to have
a long day before them, and when breakfast was over
at the inn, took the opportunity, which they very
rarely got, of slipping into the cathedral to hear the
beautiful ten-o&rsquo;clock service. Coming out the cloister
way when it was over, and so down Edgar Street,
Mrs. Jacobson espied a card in a window with
&ldquo;Lodgings&rdquo; on it. &ldquo;I wonder if they would suit Sam?&rdquo;
she cried to her husband. &ldquo;Edgar Street is a nice, wide,
open street, and quiet. Suppose we look at them?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>A young servant-maid, called by her mistress
&ldquo;Sally,&rdquo; answered the knock. Mrs. Parslet, a capable,
bustling woman of ready speech and good manners,
came out of the parlour, and took the visitors to the
floor above. They liked the rooms and they liked
Mrs. Parslet; they also liked the moderate rent asked,
for respectable country people in those days did not
live by shaving one another; and when it came out
that the house&rsquo;s master had been clerk to Lawyer
Cockermuth for twenty years, they settled the matter
off-hand, without the ceremony of consulting Sam.
Mrs. Jacobson looked upon Sam as a boy still. Mr.
Jacobson might have done the same but for the debts
made in London.</p>

<p>And all this, you will say, has been yet more explanation;
but I could not help it. The real thing
begins now, with Sam Dene&rsquo;s sojourn in Mr. Cockermuth&rsquo;s
office, and his residence in Edgar Street.</p>

<p>The first Sunday of his stay there, Sam went out to
attend the morning service in the cathedral, congratulating
himself that that grand edifice stood so
conveniently near, and looking, it must be confessed,
a bit of a dandy, for he had put a little bunch of
spring violets into his coat, and &ldquo;button-holes&rdquo; were
quite out of the common way then. The service began
with the Litany, the earlier service of prayers being
held at eight o&rsquo;clock. Sam Dene has not yet forgotten
that day, for it is no imaginary person I am telling
you of, and never will forget it. The Reverend Allen
Wheeler chanted, and the prebendary in residence
(Somers Cocks) preached. While wondering when
the sermon (a very good one) would be over, and
thinking it rather prosy, after the custom of young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
men, Sam&rsquo;s roving gaze was drawn to a young lady
sitting in the long seat opposite to him on the other
side of the choir, whose whole attention appeared to
be given to the preacher, to whom her head was
turned. It is a nice face, thought Sam; such a sweet
expression in it. It really was a nice face, rather
pretty, gentle and thoughtful, a patient look in the
dark brown eyes. She had on a well-worn dark silk,
and a straw bonnet; all very quiet and plain; but she
looked very much of a lady. Wonder if she sits there
always? thought Sam.</p>

<p>Service over, he went home, and was about to turn
the handle of the door to enter (looking another way)
when he found it turned for him by some one who
was behind and had stretched out a hand to do it.
Turning quickly, he saw the same young lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Sam, all at sea; &ldquo;did
you wish to come in here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; she answered&mdash;and her voice was
sweet and her manner modest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; repeated Sam, rather taken aback at the
answer. &ldquo;You did not want me, did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, it is my home,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your home?&rdquo; stammered Sam, for he had not seen
the ghost of any one in the house yet, saving his landlord
and landlady and Sally. &ldquo;Here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I am Maria Parslet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood back to let her enter; a slender, gentle
girl of middle height; she looked about eighteen, Sam
thought (she was that and two years on to it), and he
wondered where she had been hidden. He had to go
out again, for he was invited to dine at Lawyer
Cockermuth&rsquo;s, so he saw no more of the young lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
that day; but she kept dancing about in his memory.
And somehow she so fixed herself in it, and as the
time went on so grew in it, and at last so filled it, that
Sam may well hold that day as a marked day&mdash;the
one that introduced him to Maria Parslet. But that
is anticipating.</p>

<p>On the Monday morning all his ears and eyes were
alert, listening and looking for Maria. He did not see
her; he did not hear a sound of her. By degrees
he got to learn that the young lady was resident
teacher in a lady&rsquo;s school hard by; and that she was
often allowed to spend the whole day at home on
Sundays. One Sunday evening he ingeniously got
himself invited to take tea in Mrs. Parslet&rsquo;s parlour,
and thus became acquainted with Maria; but his
opportunities for meeting her were rare.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not much to tell of the first twelvemonth.
It passed in due course. Sam Dene was fairly
steady. He made a few debts, as some young men,
left to themselves, can&rsquo;t help making&mdash;at least,
they&rsquo;d tell you they can&rsquo;t. Sundry friends of Sam&rsquo;s
in Worcester knew of this, and somehow it reached
Mr. Cockermuth&rsquo;s ears, who gave Sam a word of advice
privately.</p>

<p>This was just as the first year expired. According
to agreement, Sam had another year to stay. He
entered upon it with inward gloom. On adding up
his scores, which he deemed it as well to do after his
master&rsquo;s lecture, he again found that they amounted
to far more than he had thought for, and how he
should contrive to pay them out of his own resources
he knew no more than the man in the moon. In
short, he could not do it; he was in a fix; and lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
in perpetual dread of its coming to the ears of his
uncle Jacobson.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The spring assize, taking place early in March, was
just over; the judges had left the town for Stafford,
and Worcester was settling down again to quietness.
Miss Cockermuth gave herself and her two handmaidens
a week&rsquo;s rest&mdash;assize time being always a
busy and bustling period at the lawyer&rsquo;s, no end of
chance company looking in&mdash;and then the house began
its spring cleaning, a grand institution with our good
grandmothers, often lasting a couple of weeks. This
time, at the lawyer&rsquo;s house, it was to be a double
bustle; for visitors were being prepared for.</p>

<p>It had pleased Captain Cockermuth to write word
that he should be at home for Easter; upon which,
the lawyer and his sister decided to invite Philip&rsquo;s
widow and her children also to spend it with them;
they knew Charles would be pleased. Easter-Day
was very early indeed that year, falling at the end of
March.</p>

<p>To make clearer what&rsquo;s coming, the house had better
have a word or two of description. You entered from
the street into a wide passage; no steps. On the left
was the parlour and general sitting-room, in which all
meals were usually taken. It was a long, low room,
its two rather narrow windows looking upon the street,
the back of the room being a little dark. Opposite
the door was the fireplace. On the other side the
passage, facing the parlour-door, was the door that
opened to the two rooms (one front, one back) used as
the lawyer&rsquo;s offices. The kitchens and staircase were
at the back of the passage, a garden lying beyond;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
and there was a handsome drawing-room on the first
floor, not much used.</p>

<p>The house, I say, was in a commotion with the
spring cleaning, and the other preparations. To
accommodate so many visitors required contrivance:
a bedroom for the captain, a bedroom for his daughter-in-law,
two bedrooms for the children. Mistress and
maids held momentous consultations together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have decided to put the three little girls in
Philip&rsquo;s old room, John,&rdquo; said Miss Betty to her
brother, as they sat in the parlour after dinner on the
Monday evening of the week preceding Passion Week;
&ldquo;and little Philip can have the small room off mine.
We shall have to get in a child&rsquo;s bed, though; I can&rsquo;t
put the three little girls in one bed; they might get
fighting. John, I do wish you&rsquo;d sell that old bureau
for what it will fetch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sell the old bureau!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Cockermuth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I should. What good does it do? Unless
that bureau goes out of the room, we can&rsquo;t put the
extra bed in. I&rsquo;ve been in there half the day with
Susan and Ann, planning and contriving, and we find
it can&rsquo;t be done any way. Do let Ward take it away,
John; there&rsquo;s no place for it in the other chambers.
He&rsquo;d give you a fair price for it, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Betty had never cared for this piece of
furniture, thinking it more awkward than useful: she
looked eagerly at her brother, awaiting his decision.
She was the elder of the two; tall, like him; but
whilst he maintained his thin, wiry form, just the
shape of an upright gas-post with arms, she had
grown stout with no shape at all. Miss Betty had
dark, thick eyebrows and an amiable red face. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
wore a &ldquo;front&rdquo; of brown curls with a high and dressy
cap perched above it. This evening her gown was
of soft twilled shot-green silk, a white net kerchief
was crossed under its body, and she had on a white
muslin apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; assented the lawyer, as easy in
disposition as Miss Betty was; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s of no use keeping
it that I know of. Send for Ward and ask him, if
you like, Betty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ward, a carpenter and cabinet-maker, who had a
shop in the town and sometimes bought second-hand
things, was sent for by Miss Betty on the following
morning; and he agreed, after some chaffering, to buy
the old bureau. It was the bureau from which Philip&rsquo;s
box of gold had disappeared&mdash;but I dare say you have
understood that. In the midst of all this stir and
clatter, just as Ward betook himself away after concluding
the negotiation, and the maids were hard at
work above stairs with mops and pails and scrubbing-brushes,
the first advance-guard of the visitors unexpectedly
walked in: Captain Cockermuth.</p>

<p>Miss Betty sat down in an access of consternation.
She could do nothing but stare. He had not been
expected for a week yet; there was nothing ready
and nowhere to put him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d take to behaving like a rational being,
Charles!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;We are all in a mess;
the rooms upside down, and the bedside carpets hanging
out at the windows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Cockermuth said he did not care for bedside
carpets, he could sleep anywhere&mdash;on the brewhouse-bench,
if she liked. He quite approved of selling the
old bureau, when told it was going to be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Ward had appointed five o&rsquo;clock that evening to
fetch it away. They were about to sit down to dinner
when he came, five o&rsquo;clock being the hour for late
dinners then in ordinary life. Ward had brought a
man with him and they went upstairs.</p>

<p>Miss Betty, as carver, sat at the top of the dining-table,
her back to the windows, the lawyer in his place
at the foot, Charles between them, facing the fire.
Miss Betty was cutting off the first joint of a loin of
veal when the bureau was heard coming down the
staircase, with much bumping and noise.</p>

<p>Mr. Cockermuth stepped out of the dining-room to
look on. The captain followed: being a sociable man
with his fellow-townspeople, he went to ask Ward
how he did.</p>

<p>The bureau came down safely, and was lodged at
the foot of the stairs; the man wiped his hot face,
while Ward spoke with Captain Cockermuth. It
seemed quite a commotion in the usual quiet dwelling.
Susan, a jug of ale in her hand, which she had been
to the cellar to draw, stood looking on from the
passage; Mr. Dene and a younger clerk, coming out
of the office just then to leave for the evening, turned
to look on also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s nothing in here, sir?&rdquo; cried Ward,
returning to business and the bureau.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I believe,&rdquo; replied Mr. Cockermuth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; called out Miss Betty through the
open parlour-door. &ldquo;I emptied the drawers this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ward, a cautious man and honest, drew back the
lid and put his hand in succession into the pigeon-holes;
which had not been used since Philip&rsquo;s time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
There were twelve of them; three above, and three
below on each side, and a little drawer that locked in
the middle. &ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; cried Ward, when his hand
was in the depth of one of them: &ldquo;here&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he drew forth the lost box. The little ebony
box with all the gold in it.</p>

<p>Well now, that was a strange thing. Worcester
thinks so, those people who are still living to remember
it, to this day. How it was that the box had appeared
to be lost and was searched for in vain over and over
again, by poor Philip and others; and how it was that
it was now recovered in this easy and natural manner,
was never explained or accounted for. Ward&rsquo;s opinion
was that the box must have been put in, side upwards,
that it had in some way stuck to the back of the deep,
narrow pigeon-hole, which just about held the box in
width, that those who had searched took the box for
the back of the hole when their fingers touched it and
that the bumping of the bureau now in coming downstairs
had dislodged the box and brought it forward.
As a maker of bureaus, Ward&rsquo;s opinion was listened to
with deference. Any way, it was a sort of theory,
serving passably well in the absence of any other. But
who knew? All that was certain about it was the
fact; the loss and the recovery after many years. It
happened just as here described, as I have already
said.</p>

<p>Sam Dene had never heard of the loss. Captain
Cockermuth, perfectly beside himself with glee, explained
it to him. Sam laughed as he touched with
his forefinger the closely packed golden guineas, lying
there so snug and safe, offered his congratulations, and
walked home to tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>It chanced that on that especial Tuesday evening,
matters were at sixes and sevens in the Parslets&rsquo; house.
Sally had misbehaved herself and was discharged in
consequence; and the servant engaged in her place,
who was to have entered that afternoon, had not made
her appearance. When Sam entered, Maria came out
of the parlour, a pretty blush upon her face. And to
Sam the unexpected sight of her, it was not often he
got a chance of it, and the blush and the sweet eyes
came like a gleam of Eden, for he had grown to love
her dearly. Not that he had owned it to himself yet.</p>

<p>Maria explained. Her school had broken up for
the Easter holidays earlier than it ought, one of the
girls showing symptoms of measles; and her mother
had gone out to see what had become of the new
servant, leaving a request that Mr. Dene would take
his tea with them in the parlour that evening, as there
was no one to wait on him.</p>

<p>Nothing loth, you may be sure, Mr. Dene accepted
the invitation, running up to wash his hands, and give
a look at his hair, and running down in a trice. The
tea-tray stood in readiness on the parlour table, Maria
sitting behind it. Perhaps she had given a look at
<em>her</em> hair, for it was quite more lovely, Sam thought,
more soft and silken than any hair he had ever seen.
The little copper kettle sang away on the hob by the
fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will papa be long, do you know?&rdquo; began Maria
demurely, feeling shy and conscious at being thus
thrown alone into Sam&rsquo;s company. &ldquo;I had better not
make the tea until he comes in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know at all,&rdquo; answered Sam. &ldquo;He went
out on some business for Mr. Cockermuth at half-past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
four, and was not back when I left. Such a curious
thing has just happened up there, Miss Parslet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed! What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam entered on the narrative. Maria, who knew
all about the strange loss of the box, grew quite excited
as she listened. &ldquo;Found!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Found
in the same bureau! And all the golden guineas
in it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every one,&rdquo; said Sam: &ldquo;as I take it. They were
packed right up to the top!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a happy thing!&rdquo; repeated Maria, in a
fervent tone that rather struck Sam, and she clasped
her fingers into one another, as one sometimes does in
pleasure or in pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that, Miss Parslet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because papa&mdash;but I do not think I ought to tell
you,&rdquo; added Maria, breaking off abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you may. I am quite safe, even if it&rsquo;s a
secret. Please do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried the easily persuaded girl, &ldquo;papa has
always had an uncomfortable feeling upon him ever
since the loss. He feared that some people, knowing
he was not well off, might think perhaps it was he
who had stolen upstairs and taken it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam laughed at that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has never <em>said</em> so, but somehow we have seen
it, my mother and I. It was altogether so mysterious
a loss, you see, affording no clue as to <em>when</em> it occurred,
that people were ready to suspect anything, however
improbable. Oh, I am thankful it is found!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kettle went on singing, the minutes went on
flitting, and still nobody came. Six o&rsquo;clock struck out
from the cathedral as Mr. Parslet entered. Had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
two been asked the time, they might have said it was
about a quarter-past five. Golden hours fly quickly;
fly on angels&rsquo; wings.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that whilst they were at tea, a
creditor of Sam&rsquo;s came to the door, one Jonas Badger.
Sam went to him: and the colloquy that ensued might
be heard in the parlour. Mr. Badger said (in quite a
fatherly way) that he really could not be put off any
longer with promises; if his money was not repaid to
him before Easter he should be obliged to take steps
about it, should write to Mr. Jacobson, of Elm Farm,
to begin with. Sam returned to the tea-table with a
wry face.</p>

<p>Soon after that, Mrs. Parslet came in, the delinquent
servant in her rear. Next, a friend of Sam&rsquo;s called,
Austin Chance, whose father was a solicitor in good
practice in the town. The two young men, who were
very intimate and often together, went up to Sam&rsquo;s
room above.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, my good young friend,&rdquo; began Chance, in
a tone that might be taken for jest or earnest,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you go and get into any entanglement in that
quarter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean now?&rdquo; demanded Sam, turning
the colour of the rising sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean Maria Parslet,&rdquo; said Austin Chance, laughing.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a deuced nice girl; I know that; just the one
a fellow might fall in love with unawares. But it
wouldn&rsquo;t do, Dene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t it do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Sam, you know it wouldn&rsquo;t. Parslet
is only a working clerk at Cockermuth&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to know what has put the thought in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
your head?&rdquo; contended Sam. &ldquo;You had better put it
out again. I&rsquo;ve never told you I was falling in love with
her; or told herself, either. Mrs. Parslet would be
about me, I expect, if I did. She looks after her as one
looks after gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I found you in their room, having tea with
them, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was quite an accident; an exceptional thing,&rdquo;
interrupted Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; repeated Austin, &ldquo;you need not put your
back up, old fellow; a friendly warning does no harm.
Talking of gold, Dene, I&rsquo;ve done my best to get up
the twenty pounds you wanted to borrow of me, and
I can&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;d let you have it with all my heart if
I could; but I find I am harder up than I thought
for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which was all true. Chance was as good-natured
a young man as ever lived, but at this early stage of
his life he made more debts than he could pay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Badger has just been here, whining and covertly
threatening,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I am to pay up in a week,
or he&rsquo;ll make me pay&mdash;and tell my uncle, he says, to
begin with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hypocritical old skinflint!&rdquo; ejaculated Chance,
himself sometimes in the hands of Mr. Badger&mdash;a
worthy gentleman who did a little benevolent usury in
a small and quiet way, and took his delight in accommodating
safe young men. A story was whispered
that young M., desperately hard-up, borrowed two
pounds from him one Saturday night, undertaking to
repay it, with two pounds added on for interest, that
day month; and when the day came and M. had not
got the money, or was at all likely to get it, he carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
off a lot of his mother&rsquo;s plate under his coat to the
pawnbroker&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s more besides Badger&rsquo;s that is pressing,&rdquo;
went on Dene. &ldquo;I must get money from somewhere,
or it will play the very deuce with me. I wonder
whether Charley Hill could lend me any?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t much think so. You might ask him. Money
seems scarce with Hill always. Has a good many
ways for it, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talking of money, Chance, a lot has been found at
Cockermuth&rsquo;s to-day. A boxful of guineas that has
been lost for years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Austin Chance stared. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that box
of guineas that mysteriously disappeared in Philip&rsquo;s
time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they say so. It is a small, round box of
carved ebony, and it is stuffed to the brim with old
guineas. Sixty of them, I hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s true; that <em>that&rsquo;s</em> found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not believe it&rsquo;s true, Chance! Why, I saw it.
Saw the box found, and touched the guineas with my
fingers. It has been hidden in an old bureau all the
time,&rdquo; added Sam, and he related the particulars of the
discovery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an extraordinary thing!&rdquo; exclaimed young
Chance: &ldquo;the queerest start I ever heard of.&rdquo; And
he fell to musing.</p>

<p>But the &ldquo;queer start,&rdquo; as Mr. Austin Chance was
pleased to designate the resuscitation of the box, did
not prove to be a lucky one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The sun shone brightly on Foregate Street, but did
not yet touch the front-windows on Lawyer Cockermuth&rsquo;s
side of it. Miss Betty Cockermuth sat near
one of them in the parlour, spectacles on nose, and
hard at work unpicking the braid off some very old
woollen curtains, green once, but now faded to a sort
of dingy brown. It was Wednesday morning, the day
following the wonderful event of finding the box, lost
so long, full of its golden guineas. In truth nobody
thought of it as anything less than marvellous.</p>

<p>The house-cleaning, in preparation for Easter and
Easter&rsquo;s visitors, was in full flow to-day, and would
be for more than a week to come; the two maids
were hard at it above. Ward, who did not disdain to
labour with his own hands, was at the house, busy at
some mysterious business in the brewhouse, coat off,
shirt-sleeves stripped up to elbow, plunging at that
moment something or other into the boiling water of
the furnace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I could have let them remain up so long in
this state, I can&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said Miss Betty to herself,
arresting her employment, scissors in hand, to regard
the dreary curtains. She had drawn the table towards
her from the middle of the room, and the heavy work
was upon it. Susan came in to impart some domestic
news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ward says there&rsquo;s a rare talk in the town about
the finding of that box, missis,&rdquo; cried she, when she
had concluded it. &ldquo;My! how bad them curtains look,
now they&rsquo;re down!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Servants were on more familiar terms with their
mistresses in those days without meaning, or showing,
any disrespect; identifying themselves, as it were,
with the family and its interests. Susan, a plump,
red-cheeked young woman turned thirty, had been
housemaid in her present place for seven years. She
had promised a baker&rsquo;s head man to marry him, but
never could be got to fix the day. In winter she&rsquo;d
say to him, &ldquo;Wait till summer;&rdquo; and when summer
came, she&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Wait till winter.&rdquo; Miss Betty commended
her prudence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she now, in answer to the girl, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been wondering how we could have kept them up so
long; they are not fit for much, I&rsquo;m afraid, save the ragbag.
Chintz will make the room look much nicer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Susan left the parlour, Captain Cockermuth
entered it, a farmer with him who had come in from
Hallow to the Wednesday&rsquo;s market. The captain&rsquo;s
delighted excitement at the finding of the box had not
at all subsided; he had dreamt of it, he talked of it,
he pinned every acquaintance he could pick up this
morning and brought him in to see the box of gold.
Independently of its being a very great satisfaction to
have had the old mysterious loss cleared up, the sixty
guineas would be a huge boon to the captain&rsquo;s pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how was it that none of you ever found it, if
it remained all this while in the pigeon-hole?&rdquo; cried
the wondering farmer, bending over the little round
box of guineas, which the captain placed upon the
table open, the lid by its side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we didn&rsquo;t find it, that&rsquo;s all I know; or poor
Philip, either,&rdquo; said Captain Cockermuth.</p>

<p>The farmer took his departure. As the captain was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
showing him to the front-door, another gentleman
came hustling in. It was Thomas Chance the lawyer,
father of the young man who had been the previous
night with Samson Dene. He and Lawyer Cockermuth
were engaged together just then in some complicated,
private, and very disagreeable business, each
acting for a separate client, who were the defendants
against a great wrong&mdash;or what they thought was one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, Chance, and take a look at my box of
guineas, resuscitated from the grave,&rdquo; cried the captain,
joyously. &ldquo;You can go into the office to John afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve hardly time this morning,&rdquo; answered
Mr. Chance, turning, though, into the parlour and
shaking hands with Miss Betty. &ldquo;Austin told me it
was found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now it happened that Lawyer Cockermuth came
then into the parlour himself, to get something from
his private desk-table which stood there. When the
box had been discussed, Mr. Chance took a letter
from his pocket and placed it in his brother practitioner&rsquo;s
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I got it
by post this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think! why, that it is of vital importance,&rdquo; said
Mr. Cockermuth when he had read it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; no doubt of that. But what is to be our
next move in answer to it?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>

<p>Seeing they were plunging into business, the captain
strolled away to the front-door, which stood open all
day, for the convenience of those coming to the office,
and remained there whistling, his hands in his pockets,
on the look out for somebody else to bring in. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
had put the lid on the box of guineas, and left the box
on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to take a copy of this letter,&rdquo; said
Mr. Cockermuth to the other lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you can take it,&rdquo; answered Chance. &ldquo;Mind
who does it, though&mdash;Parslet, or somebody else that&rsquo;s
confidential. Don&rsquo;t let it go into the office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are wanted, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Dene, from the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked his master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chamberlain. He says he is in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming. Here, Dene!&rdquo; he called out as the
latter was turning away: and young Dene came back
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down here, now, and take a copy of this letter,&rdquo;
cried the lawyer, rapidly drawing out and opening the
little writing-desk table that stood against the wall at
the back of the room. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s pen, ink and paper,
all ready: the letter is confidential, you perceive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went out of the room as he spoke, Mr. Chance
with him; and Sam Dene sat down to commence his
task, after exchanging a few words with Miss Betty,
with whom he was on good terms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charles makes as much fuss over this little box as
if it were filled with diamonds from Golconda, instead
of guineas,&rdquo; remarked she, pointing with her scissors
to the box, which stood near her on the table, to direct
the young man&rsquo;s attention to it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how
many folks he has not brought in already to have a
look at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it was a capital find, Miss Betty; one to be
proud of,&rdquo; answered Sam, settling to his work.</p>

<p>For some little time nothing was heard but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
scratching of Mr. Dene&rsquo;s pen and the clicking of Miss
Betty&rsquo;s scissors. Her task was nearing completion.
A few minutes more, and the last click was given, the
last bit of the braid was off. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad of it,&rdquo;
cried she aloud, flinging the end of the curtain on the
top of the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This braid will do again for something or other,&rdquo;
considered Miss Betty, as she began to wind it upon
an old book. &ldquo;It was put on fresh only three or four
years ago. Well brushed, it will look almost like
new.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Susan opened the door. &ldquo;Miss Betty, here&rsquo;s
the man come with the chintz: five or six rolls of it
for you to choose from,&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;Shall he come in
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Betty was about to say Yes, but stopped and
said No, instead. The commotion of holding up the
chintzes to the light, to judge of their different merits,
might disturb Mr. Dene; and she knew better than to
interrupt business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him take them to the room where they are to
hang, Susan; we can judge best there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tossing the braid to Susan, who stood waiting at
the door, Miss Betty hastily took up her curtains, and
Susan held the door open for her mistress to pass
through.</p>

<p>Choosing chintz for window-curtains takes some
time; as everybody knows whose fancy is erratic.
And how long Miss Betty and Susan and the young
man from the chintz-mart had been doubting and
deciding and doubting again, did not quite appear,
when Captain Cockermuth&rsquo;s voice was heard ascending
from below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty! Are you upstairs, Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; she called back, crossing to the
door to speak. &ldquo;Do you want me, Charles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you put the box?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What box?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The box of guineas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is on the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not on the table. I can&rsquo;t see it anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was on the table when I left the parlour. I
did not touch it. Ask Mr. Dene where it is: I left
him there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dene&rsquo;s not here. I wish you&rsquo;d come down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well; I&rsquo;ll come in a minute or two,&rdquo; concluded
Miss Betty, going back to the chintzes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I saw that box on the table as I shut the
door after you had come out, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; observed Susan,
who had listened to the colloquy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; said Miss Betty; &ldquo;it was the very last
thing my eyes fell on. If young Mr. Dene finished
what he was about and left the parlour, I dare say he
put the box up somewhere for safety. I think, Susan,
we must fix upon this light pea-green with the rosebuds
running up it. It matches the paper: and the
light coming through it takes quite a nice shade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little more indecision yet; and yet a little more,
as to whether the curtains should be lined, or not, and
then Miss Cockermuth went downstairs. The captain
was pacing the passage to and fro impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then, Betty, where&rsquo;s my box?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how am I to know where the box is, Charles,
if it&rsquo;s not on the table?&rdquo; she remonstrated, turning
into the parlour, where two friends of the captain&rsquo;s
waited to be regaled with the sight of the recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
treasure. &ldquo;I had to go upstairs with the young man
who brought the chintzes; and I left the box here&rdquo;&mdash;indicating
the exact spot on the table. &ldquo;It was
where you left it yourself. I did not touch it at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook hands with the visitors. Captain
Cockermuth looked gloomy&mdash;as if he were at sea and
had lost his reckoning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you had to leave the room, why didn&rsquo;t you put
the box up?&rdquo; asked he. &ldquo;A boxful of guineas
shouldn&rsquo;t be left alone in an empty room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Dene was in the room; he sat at the
desk there, copying a letter for John. As to why
didn&rsquo;t I put the box up, it was not my place to do so
that I know of. You were about yourself, Charles&mdash;only
at the front-door, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Cockermuth was aware that he had not
been entirely at the front-door. Two or three times
he had crossed over to hold a chat with acquaintances
on the other side the way; had strolled with one of
them nearly up to Salt Lane and back. Upon catching
hold of these two gentlemen, now brought in, he
had found the parlour empty of occupants and the
box not to be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is a nice thing&mdash;that a man can&rsquo;t put
his hand upon his own property when he wants to, or
hear where it is!&rdquo; grumbled he. &ldquo;And what business
on earth had Dene to meddle with the box?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To put it in safety&mdash;if he did meddle with it, and
a sensible thing to do,&rdquo; retorted Miss Betty, who did
not like to be scolded unjustly. &ldquo;Just like you,
Charles, making a fuss over nothing! Why don&rsquo;t
you go and ask young Dene where it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young Dene is not in. And John&rsquo;s not in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Nobody is in but Parslet; and he does not know
anything about it. I must say, Betty, you manage
the house nicely!&rdquo; concluded the captain ironically,
giving way to his temper.</p>

<p>This was, perhaps the reader may think, commotion
enough &ldquo;over nothing,&rdquo; as Miss Betty put it. But it
was not much as compared with the commotion which
set in later. When Mr. Cockermuth came in, he
denied all knowledge of it, and Sam Dene was impatiently
waited for.</p>

<p>It was past two o&rsquo;clock when he returned, for he
had been home to dinner. The good-looking young
fellow turned in at the front-door with a fleet step,
and encountered Captain Cockermuth, who attacked
him hotly, demanding what he had done with the
box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Sam, lightly and coolly, &ldquo;Parslet said
you were looking for it.&rdquo; Mr. Parslet had in fact
mentioned it at home over his dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, where is it?&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Where
did you put it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; cried young Dene. &ldquo;Not anywhere. Should
I be likely to touch the box, sir? I saw the box on
that table while I was copying a letter for Mr. Cockermuth;
that&rsquo;s all I know of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain turned red, and pale, and red again.
&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me to my face, Mr. Dene, that
the box is <em>gone</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Sam in the easiest
of all easy tones. &ldquo;It seems to be gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The box was gone. Gone once more with all its
golden guineas. It could not be found anywhere; in
the house or out of the house, upstairs or down. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
captain searched frantically, the others helped him,
but no trace of it could be found.</p>

<p>At first it was impossible to believe it. That this
self-same box should mysteriously have vanished a
second time, seemed to be too marvellous for fact.
But it was true.</p>

<p>Nobody would admit a share in the responsibility.
The captain left the box safe amidst (as he put it) a
roomful of people: Miss Betty considered that she
left it equally safe, with Mr. Dene seated at the
writing-table, and the captain dodging (as <em>she</em> put it)
in and out. Mr. Cockermuth had not entered the
parlour since he left it, when called to Mr. Chamberlain,
with whom he had gone out. Sam Dene
reiterated that he had not meddled with the box; no,
nor thought about it.</p>

<p>Sam&rsquo;s account, briefly given, was this. After finishing
copying the letter, he closed the little table-desk
and pushed it back to its place against the wall, and
had carried the letter and the copy into the office.
Finding Mr. Cockermuth was not there, he locked
them up in his own desk, having to go to the
Guildhall upon some business. The business there
took up some time, in fact until past one o&rsquo;clock, and
he then went home to dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did you consider it right, Sam Dene, to leave
a valuable box like that on the table, unguarded?&rdquo;
demanded Captain Cockermuth, as they all stood
together in the parlour, after questioning Sam; and
the captain had been looking so fierce and speaking
so sharply that it might be thought he was taking
Sam for the thief, off-hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell the truth, captain, I never thought of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
box,&rdquo; answered Sam. &ldquo;I might not have noticed that
the box was in the room at all but for Miss Betty&rsquo;s
drawing my attention to it. After that, I grew so
much interested in the letter I was copying (for I
know all about the cause, as Mr. Cockermuth is aware,
and it was curious news) that I forgot everything
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lawyer Cockermuth nodded to confirm this. The
captain went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty drew your attention to it, did she? Why
did she draw it? In what way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she remarked that you made as much fuss
over that box as if it were filled with diamonds,&rdquo;
replied the young man, glad to pay out the captain
for his angry and dictatorial tone. But the captain
was in truth beginning to entertain a very ominous
suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to deny, Samson Dene, that my sister
Betty left that box on the table when she quitted the
room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, who does?&rdquo; cried Sam. &ldquo;When Miss Betty
says she left the box on the table, of course she did
leave it. She must know. Susan, it seems, also saw
that it was left there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you could see that box of guineas standing
stark staring on the table, and come out of the room
and leave it to its fate!&rdquo; foamed the captain. &ldquo;Instead
of giving me a call to say nobody was on guard
here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; returned Sam. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt
it was there, but I did not see it. I never looked
towards the table as I came out, that I know of. The
table, as I dare say you remember, was not in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
usual place; it was up there by the window. The
box had gone clean out of my thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Dene, my impression is that <em>you have got
the box</em>,&rdquo; cried the angry captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is it!&rdquo; returned Sam, with supreme good
humour, and just the least suspicion of a laugh. &ldquo;A
box like that would be uncommonly useful to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect, young man, the guineas would!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right you are, captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Captain Cockermuth regarded this mocking
pleasantry as particularly ill-timed. <em>He believed the
young man was putting it on to divert suspicion from
himself.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did take the box?&rdquo; questioned he. &ldquo;Tell
me that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could the box vanish off the table unless it
was taken, I ask you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a puzzling question,&rdquo; coolly rejoined Sam.
&ldquo;It was too heavy for the rats, I expect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, but we have no rats in the house,&rdquo; cried
Miss Betty. &ldquo;I wish we had, I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;and could
find the box in their holes.&rdquo; She was feeling tolerably
uncomfortable. Placid and easy in a general way,
serious worry always upset her considerably.</p>

<p>Captain Cockermuth&rsquo;s suspicions were becoming
certainties. The previous night, when his brother had
been telling him various items of news of the old
town, as they sat confidentially over the fire after
Miss Betty had gone up to bed, Mr. Cockermuth
chanced to mention the fact that young Dene had been
making a few debts. Not speaking in any ill-natured
spirit, quite the contrary, for he liked the young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
amazingly. Only a few, he continued; thoughtless
young men would do so; and he had given him a
lecture. And then he laughingly added the information
that Mr. Jacobson had imparted to him twelve
months ago, in their mutual friendship&mdash;of the debts
Sam had made in London.</p>

<p>No sensible person can be surprised that Charles
Cockermuth recalled this now. It rankled in his
mind. Had Sam Dene taken the box of guineas to
satisfy these debts contracted during the past year at
Worcester? It looked like it. And the longer the
captain dwelt on it, the more and more likely it grew
to look.</p>

<p>All the afternoon the search was kept up by the
captain. Not an individual article in the parlour but
was turned inside out; he wanted to have the carpet
up. His brother and Sam Dene had returned to their
work in the office as usual. The captain was getting
to feel like a raging bear; three times Miss Betty had
to stop him in a dreadful fit of swearing; and when
dinner-time came he could not eat. It was a beautiful
slice of Severn salmon, which had its price, I can tell
you, in Worcester then, and minced veal, and a jam
tart, all of which dishes Charles Cockermuth especially
favoured. But the loss of the sixty guineas did away
with his appetite. Mr. Cockermuth, who took the
loss very coolly, laughed at him.</p>

<p>The laughing did not mend the captain&rsquo;s temper:
neither did the hearing that Sam Dene had departed
for home as usual at five o&rsquo;clock. Had Sam been
innocent, he would at least have come to the parlour
and inquired whether the box was found, instead of
sneaking off home to tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>Fretting and fuming, raging and stamping, disturbing
the parlour&rsquo;s peace and his own, strode Charles
Cockermuth. His good-humoured brother John bore
it for an hour or two, and then told him he might as
well go outside and stamp on the pavement for a
bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Charles. Catching up his hat, saying
nothing to anybody, he strode off to see the sergeant
of police&mdash;Dutton&mdash;and laid the case concisely before
him: The box of guineas was on the table where his
sister sat at work; her work being at one end, the box
at the other. Sam Dene was also in the room, copying
a letter at the writing-table. Miss Betty was called
upstairs; she went, leaving the box on the table. It
was the last thing she saw as she left the room; the
servant, who had come to call her, also saw it standing
there. Presently young Dene also left the room and
the house; and from that moment the box was never
seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you make of that, Mr. Dutton?&rdquo; summed
up Captain Cockermuth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I to understand that no other person entered
the room after Mr. Dene quitted it?&rdquo; inquired the
sergeant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a soul. I can testify to that myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it looks as though Mr. Dene must have
taken the box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; assented the complainant, triumphantly.
&ldquo;And I shall give him into custody for stealing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Dutton considered. His judgment was cool;
the captain&rsquo;s hot. He thought there might be ins and
outs in this affair that had not yet come to the surface.
Besides that, he knew young Dene, and did not much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
fancy him the sort of individual likely to do a thing
of this kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Cockermuth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I think it might
be best for me to come up to the house and see a bit
into the matter personally, before proceeding to extreme
measures. We experienced officers have a way
of turning up scraps of evidence that other people
would never look at. Perhaps, after all, the box is
only mislaid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I tell you it&rsquo;s <em>lost</em>,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Clean
gone. Can&rsquo;t be found high or low.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if that same black box is lost again, I can
only say it is the oddest case I ever heard of. One
would think the box had a demon inside it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sergeant, you are wrong there. The demon&rsquo;s
inside him that took it. Listen while I whisper something
in your ear&mdash;that young Dene is over head and
ears in debt: he has debts here, debts there, debts
everywhere. For some little time now, as I chance to
know, he has been at his very wits&rsquo; end to think
where or how he could pick up some money to satisfy
the most pressing; fit to die of fear, lest they should
travel to the knowledge of his uncle at Elm Farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Is</em> it so?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Dutton, severely. And
his face changed, and his opinion also. &ldquo;Are you sure
of this, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my informant was my brother; so you may
judge whether it is likely to be correct or not,&rdquo; said
the captain. &ldquo;But, if you think it best to make
some inquiries at the house, come with me now and
do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked to Foregate together. The sergeant
looked a little at the features of the parlour, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the loss had taken place, and heard what Miss Betty
had to say, and questioned Susan. This did not help
the suspicion thrown on Sam Dene, saving in one point&mdash;their
joint testimony that he and the box were left
alone in the room together.</p>

<p>Mr. Cockermuth had gone out, so the sergeant did
not see him: but, as he was not within doors when
the loss occurred, he could not have aided the investigation
in any way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Dutton, what do you think now?&rdquo; asked
Captain Cockermuth, strolling down the street with
the sergeant when he departed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I confess my visit has not helped me much,&rdquo; said
Dutton, a slow-speaking man, given to be cautious.
&ldquo;If nobody entered the room between the time when
Miss Cockermuth left it and you entered it, why then,
sir, there&rsquo;s only young Dene to fall back upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you nobody did enter it,&rdquo; cried the choleric
captain; &ldquo;or <em>could</em>, without my seeing them. I stood
at the front-door. Ward was busy at the house that
morning, dodging perpetually across the top of the
passage, between the kitchen and brewhouse: he, too,
is sure no stranger could have come in without being
seen by him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see young Dene leave the room, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did. Hearing somebody come out of the parlour,
I looked round and saw it was young Dene with some
papers in his hand. He went into the office for a
minute or two, and then passed me, remarking, with
all the impudence in life, that he was going to the
town hall. He must have had my box in his pocket
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pity but you had gone into the parlour at once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
captain,&rdquo; remarked the sergeant. &ldquo;If only to put the
box in safety&mdash;provided it was there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought it was safe. I thought my sister
was there. I did go in almost directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you never stirred from the door&mdash;from first
to last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that. When I first stood there I
strolled about a little, talking with one person and
another. <em>But I did not stir from the door after I
saw Sam Dene leave the parlour.</em> And I do not think
five minutes elapsed before I went in. Not more than
five, I am quite certain. What are you thinking about,
Dutton?&mdash;you don&rsquo;t seem to take me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take you well enough, sir, and all you say. But
what is puzzling me in the matter is this; strikes me
as strange, in fact: that Mr. Dene should do the thing
(allowing that he has done it) in so open and barefaced
a manner, laying himself open to immediate
suspicion. Left alone in the room with the box by
Miss Betty, he must know that if, when he left it, the
box vanished with him, only one inference would be
drawn. Most thieves exercise some caution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not when they are as hard up as Dene is. Impudence
with them is the order of the day, and often
carries luck with it. Nothing risk, nothing win, they
cry, and they <em>do</em> risk&mdash;and win. Dene has got my
box, sergeant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, it looks dark against him; almost <em>too</em>
dark; and if you decide to give him into custody, of
course we have only to&mdash;&mdash; Good-evening, Badger!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had strolled as far as the Cross, and were
standing on the wide pavement in front of St. Nicholas&rsquo;
Church, about to part, when that respectable gentleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Jonas Badger, passed by. A thought struck the
captain. He knew the man was a money-lender in a
private way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Badger, stop a minute,&rdquo; he hastily cried. &ldquo;I
want to ask you a question about young Dene&mdash;my
brother&rsquo;s clerk, you know. Does he owe you money?&mdash;Much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Badger, wary by nature and by habit, glanced
first at the questioner and then at the police-sergeant,
and did not answer. Whereupon Captain Cockermuth,
as an excuse for his curiosity, plunged into the
history of what had occurred: the finding of the box
of guineas yesterday and the losing it again to-day,
and the doubt of Sam.</p>

<p>Mr. Badger listened with interest; for the news of
that marvellous find had not yet reached his ears. He
had been shut up in his office all the morning, very
busy over his account-books; and in the afternoon
had walked over to Kempsey, where he had a client
or two, getting back only in time for tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That long-lost box of guineas come to light at
last!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What an extraordinary thing!
And Mr. Dene is suspected of&mdash;&mdash; Why, good
gracious!&rdquo; he broke off in fresh astonishment, &ldquo;I have
just seen him with a guinea in his pocket!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seen a guinea in Sam Dene&rsquo;s pocket!&rdquo; cried
Captain Cockermuth, turning yellow as the gas-flame
under which they were standing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why yes, I have. It was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there Mr. Badger came to a full stop. It had
suddenly struck him that he might be doing harm to
Sam Dene; and the rule of his life was not to harm
any one, or to make an enemy, if his own interest
allowed him to avoid it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say any more, Captain Cockermuth. It is
no business of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But here Mr. Sergeant Dutton came to the fore.
&ldquo;You must, Badger. You must say all you know
that bears upon the affair; the law demands it of you.
What about the guinea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you force me to do so&mdash;putting it in that
way,&rdquo; returned the man, driven into a corner.</p>

<p>Mr. Badger had just been down to Edgar Street to
pay another visit to Sam. Not to torment him; he
did not do that more than he could help; but simply
to say he would accept smaller instalments for the
liquidation of his debt&mdash;which of course meant giving
to Sam a longer time to pay the whole in. This evening
he was admitted to Sam&rsquo;s sitting-room. During
their short conversation, Sam, searching impatiently
for a pencil in his waistcoat-pocket, drew out with it
a few coins in silver money, and one coin in gold.
Mr. Badger&rsquo;s hungry eyes saw that it was an old
guinea. These particulars he now imparted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he <em>say</em> about the guinea?&rdquo; cried Captain
Cockermuth, his own eyes glaring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; said Badger; &ldquo;neither did I. He
slipped it back into his pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you think there&rsquo;s some proof to go upon
<em>now</em>,&rdquo; were Charles Cockermuth&rsquo;s last words to the
police-officer as he wished him good-night.</p>

<p>On the following morning, Sam Dene was apprehended,
and taken before the magistrates. Beyond
being formally charged, very little was done; Miss
Betty was in bed with a sick headache, brought on by
the worry, and could not appear to give evidence; so
he was remanded on bail until Saturday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you might have thought all his rick-yards
were on fire by the way old Jacobson came bursting
in. It was Saturday morning, and we were at breakfast
at Dyke Manor. He had run every step of the
way from Elm Farm, two miles nearly, not having
patience to wait for his gig, and came in all excitement,
the <cite>Worcester Herald</cite> in his hand. The Squire
started from his chair; Mrs. Todhetley, then in the act
of pouring out a cup of coffee, let it flow over on to
the tablecloth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth&rsquo;s amiss, Jacobson?&rdquo; cried the
Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, what&rsquo;s amiss,&rdquo; stuttered Jacobson in answer;
&ldquo;<em>this</em> is amiss,&rdquo; holding out the newspaper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prosecute
the editor as sure as I&rsquo;m a living man. It is a
conspiracy got up to sell it; a concocted lie. It can&rsquo;t
be anything else, you know, Todhetley. And I want
you to go off with me to Worcester. The gig&rsquo;s following
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we had somewhat collected our senses, and
could look at the newspaper, there was the account as
large as life. Samson Reginald Dene had been had
up before the magistrates on Thursday morning on
a charge of stealing a small box of carved ebony, containing
sixty guineas in gold, from the dwelling house
of Lawyer Cockermuth; and he was to be brought up
again that day, Saturday, for examination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty thing this is to see, when a man opens
his weekly newspaper at his breakfast-table!&rdquo; gasped
Jacobson, flicking the report with his angry finger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the law of them&mdash;accusing <em>my</em> nephew
of such a thing as that! You&rsquo;ll go with me,
Squire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go! of course I&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo; returned the Squire, in his
hot partisanship. &ldquo;We were going to Worcester, any
way; I&rsquo;ve things to do there. Poor Sam! Hanging
would be too good for the printers of that newspaper,
Jacobson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Jacobson&rsquo;s gig was heard driving up to the
gate at railroad speed; and soon our own carriage was
ready. Old Jacobson sat with the Squire, I behind
with Giles; the other groom, Blossom, drove Tod in
the gig; and away we went in the blustering March
wind. Many people, farmers and others, were on the
road, riding or driving to Worcester market.</p>

<p>Well, we found it was true. And not the mistake
of the newspapers: they had but reported what passed
before the magistrates at the town hall.</p>

<p>The first person we saw was Miss Cockermuth.
She was in a fine way, not knowing what to think or
believe, and sat in the parlour in that soft green gown
of twilled silk (that might have been a relic of the
silk made in the time of the Queen of Sheba), her
cap and front all awry. Rumour said old Jacobson
had been a sweetheart of hers in their young days;
but I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. Any way they were very
friendly with one another, and she sometimes called
him &ldquo;Frederick.&rdquo; He sat down by her on the horse-hair
sofa, and we took chairs.</p>

<p>She recounted the circumstances (ramblingly) from
beginning to end. Not that the end had come yet by
a long way. And&mdash;there it was, she wound up, when
the narrative was over: the box had disappeared, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
for all the world as mysteriously as it disappeared in
the days gone by.</p>

<p>Mr. Jacobson had listened patiently. He was a fine,
upright man, with a healthy colour and bright dark
eyes. He wore a blue frock-coat to-day with metal
buttons, and top-boots. As yet he did not see how
they had got up grounds for accusing Sam, and he
said so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; cried the Squire. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that, Miss
Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; said Miss Betty&mdash;&ldquo;that
nobody was here in the parlour but Sam when the
box vanished. It is my brother Charles who has
done it all; he is so passionate, you know. John has
properly quarrelled with him for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not possible, you know, Miss Betty, that Sam
Dene could have done it,&rdquo; struck in Tod, who was
boiling over with rage at the whole thing. &ldquo;Some
thief must have stolen in at the street-door when
Sam had left the room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no, that could hardly have been, seeing that
Charles never left the street-door after that,&rdquo; returned
Miss Betty, mildly. &ldquo;It appears to be a certain fact
that not a soul entered the room after the young man
left it. And there lies the puzzle of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Putting it to be as Miss Betty put it&mdash;and I may
as well say here that nothing turned up, then or later,
to change the opinion&mdash;it looked rather suspicious for
Sam Dene. I think the Squire saw it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are sure the box was on the table
when you left the room, Miss Betty?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I am sure, Squire,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;It was the last thing my eyes fell on; for, as I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
through the door, I glanced back to see that I had left
the table tidy. Susan can bear witness to that.
Dutton, the police-sergeant, thinks some demon of
mischief must be in that box&mdash;meaning the deuce,
you know. Upon my word it looks like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Susan came in with some glasses and ale as Miss
Betty spoke, and confirmed the testimony&mdash;which did
not need confirmation. As she closed the parlour-door,
she said, after her mistress had passed out, she noticed
the box standing on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Sam here to-day&mdash;in the office?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Jacobson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my goodness, no,&rdquo; cried Miss Betty in a fluster.
&ldquo;Why, Frederick, he has not been here since
Thursday, when they had him up at the Guildhall.
He couldn&rsquo;t well come while the charge is hanging
over him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I think we had better go out to find Sam,
and hear what he has to say,&rdquo; observed Mr. Jacobson,
drinking up his glass of ale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; said Miss Betty. &ldquo;Tell poor Sam I&rsquo;m as
sorry as I can be&mdash;pestered almost out of my mind
over it. And as to their having found one of the
guineas in his pocket, please just mention to him that
I say it might have slipped in accidentally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the guineas found in Sam&rsquo;s pocket!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. Jacobson, taken aback.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hear so,&rdquo; responded Miss Betty. &ldquo;The
police searched him, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the Squire and Mr. Jacobson went out, Mr.
Cockermuth was coming in. They all turned into
the office together, while we made a rush to Sam
Dene&rsquo;s lodgings in Edgar Street: as much of a rush,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
at least, as the Saturday&rsquo;s streets would let us make.
Sam was out, the young servant said when we got
there, and while parleying with her Mrs. Parslet
opened her sitting-room door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not suppose Mr. Dene will be long,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;He has to appear at the town hall this morning, and
I think it likely he will come home first. Will you
walk in and wait?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She handed us into her parlour, where she had been
busy, marking sheets and pillow-cases and towels
with &ldquo;prepared&rdquo; ink; the table was covered with
them. Tod began telling her that Mr. Jacobson
was at Worcester, and went on to say what a
shame it was that Sam Dene should be accused of
this thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We consider it so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Parslet; who was a
capable, pleasant-speaking woman, tall and slender.
&ldquo;My husband says it has upset Mr. Cockermuth more
than anything that has occurred for years past. He
tells his brother that he should have had it investigated
privately, not have given Mr. Dene into custody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why did he let him do it, Mrs. Parslet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at Tod, as if surprised at the question.
&ldquo;Mr. Cockermuth knew nothing of it; you may be
sure of that. Captain Cockermuth had the young
man at the Guildhall and was preferring the charge,
before Mr. Cockermuth heard a word of what was
agate. Certainly that is a most mysterious box! It
seems fated to give trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened, and a young lady
came into the parlour. It was Maria. What a nice
face she had!&mdash;what sweet thoughtful eyes!&mdash;what
gentle manners! Sam&rsquo;s friends in the town were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
accusing him of being in love with her&mdash;and small
blame to him.</p>

<p>But Sam did not appear to be coming home, and
time was getting on. Tod decided not to wait longer,
and said good-morning.</p>

<p>Flying back along High Street, we caught sight of
the tray of Dublin buns, just put fresh on the counter
in Rousse&rsquo;s shop, and made as good a feast as time
allowed. Some people called them Doubling buns
(from their shape, I take it), and I don&rsquo;t know to this
day which was right.</p>

<p>Away with fleet foot again, past the bustle round
the town hall, and market house, till we came to the
next confectioner&rsquo;s and saw the apple-tarts. Perhaps
somebody remembers yet how delicious those apple-tarts
were. Bounding in, we began upon them.</p>

<p>While the feast was in progress, Sam Dene went by,
walking very fast. We dashed out to catch him.
Good Mrs. Mountford chanced to be in the shop and
knew us, or they might have thought we were
decamping without payment.</p>

<p>Sam Dene, in answer to Tod&rsquo;s hasty questions, went
into a passion; swearing at the world in general, and
Captain Cockermuth in particular, as freely as though
the justices, then taking their places in the Guildhall,
were not as good as within earshot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a fearful shame, Todhetley!&mdash;to bring such
a charge against me, and to lug me up to the criminal
bar like a felon. Worse than all, to let it go forth to
the town and county in to-day&rsquo;s glaring newspapers
that I, Sam Dene, am a common thief!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it is a fearful shame, Sam&mdash;it&rsquo;s infamous,
and all your friends know it is,&rdquo; cried Tod, with eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
sympathy. &ldquo;My father wishes he could hang the
printers. I say, what do you think has become of
the box?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Become of it!&mdash;why, that blundering Charles
Cockermuth has got it. He was off his head with
excitement at its being found. He must have come
into the room and put it somewhere and forgotten it:
or else he put it into his pocket and got robbed of it
in the street. That&rsquo;s what I think. Quite off his
head, I give you my word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what fable is it the wretches have got up
about finding one of the guineas in your pocket, Sam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother that! It was my own guinea. I swear
it&mdash;there! I can&rsquo;t stay now,&rdquo; went on Sam, striding
off down High Street. &ldquo;I am due at the town hall
this minute; only out on bail. You&rsquo;ll come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go in and pay for the tarts, Johnny,&rdquo; called
back Tod, as he put his arm within Sam Dene&rsquo;s. I
looked in, pitched a shilling on the counter, said
I didn&rsquo;t know how many we had eaten; perhaps ten;
and that I couldn&rsquo;t wait for change.</p>

<p>Crushing my way amidst the market women and
their baskets in the Guildhall yard, I came upon
Austin Chance. His father held some post connected
with the law, as administered there, and Austin said
he would get me in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can it be true that the police found one of the
guineas about him?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>Chance pulled a long face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true they found
one when they searched him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What right had they to search him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Austin, laughing a little;
&ldquo;they did it. To see perhaps whether all the guineas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
were about him. And I am afraid, Johnny Ludlow,
that the finding of that guinea will make it rather
hard for Sam. It is said that Maria Parslet can prove
the guinea was Sam&rsquo;s own, and that my father has
had a summons served on her to appear here to-day.
He has taken Sam&rsquo;s case in hand; but he is closer
than wax, and tells me nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think he can have stolen the box,
Chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I shouldn&rsquo;t think him capable of anything
so mean; let alone the danger of it. Not but that
there are circumstances in the case that tell uncommonly
strong against him. And where the deuce the
box can have got to, otherwise, is more than mortal
man can guess at. Come along.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Not for a long while had Worcester been stirred as it
was over this affair of Samson Dene&rsquo;s. What with
the curious discovery of the box of guineas after its
mysterious disappearance of years, and then its second
no less mysterious loss, with the suspicion that Sam
Dene stole it, the Faithful City was so excited as
hardly to know whether it stood on its head or its
heels.</p>

<p>When the police searched the prisoner on Thursday
morning, after taking him into custody, and found
the guinea upon him (having been told that he
had one about him), his guilt was thought to be as
good as proved. Sam said the guinea was his own,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
an heirloom, and stood to this so indignantly resolute
that the police let him have it back. But now, what
did Sam go and do? When released upon bail by the
magistrates&mdash;to come up again on the Saturday&mdash;he
went straight off to a silversmith&rsquo;s, had a hole stamped
in the guinea and hung it to his watch-chain across
his waistcoat, that the public might feast their eyes
upon it. It was in this spirit of defiance&mdash;or, as the
town called it, bravado&mdash;that he met the charge. His
lodgings had been searched for the rest of the guineas,
but they were not found.</p>

<p>The hour for the Saturday&rsquo;s examination&mdash;twelve
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;was striking, as I struggled my way with
Austin Chance through the crush round the Guildhall.
But that Austin&rsquo;s father was a man of consequence
with the door-keepers, we should not have got in
at all.</p>

<p>The accused, arraigned by his full name, Samson
Reginald Dene, stood in the place allotted to prisoners,
cold defiance on his handsome face. As near to him
as might be permitted, stood Tod, just as defiant as he.
Captain Charles Cockermuth, a third in defiance, stood
opposite to prosecute; while Lawyer Cockermuth, who
came in with Sam&rsquo;s uncle, Mr. Jacobson, openly wished
his brother at Hanover. Squire Todhetley, being a
county magistrate, sat on the bench with the City
magnates, but not to interfere.</p>

<p>The proceedings began. Captain Cockermuth related
how the little box, his property, containing sixty
golden guineas, was left on the table in a sitting-room
in his brother&rsquo;s house, the accused being the only
person in the room at the time, and that the box disappeared.
He, himself (standing at the front-door),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
saw the accused quit the room; he went into it almost
immediately, but the box was gone. He swore that
no person entered the room after the prisoner left it.</p>

<p>Miss Betty Cockermuth, flustered and red, appeared
next. She testified that she was in the room nearly
all the morning, the little box being upon the table;
when she left the room, Mr. Dene remained in it alone,
copying a letter for her brother; the box was still on
the table. Susan Edwards, housemaid at Lawyer
Cockermuth&rsquo;s, spoke to the same fact. It was she who
had fetched her mistress out, and she saw the box
standing upon the table.</p>

<p>The accused was asked by one of the magistrates
what he had to say to this. He answered, speaking
freely, that he had nothing to say in contradiction,
except that he did not know what became of the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see the box on the table?&rdquo; asked the
lawyer on the opposite side, Mr. Standup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw it there when I first went into the room.
Miss Betty made a remark about the box, which drew
my attention to it. I was sitting at the far end of the
room, at Mr. Cockermuth&rsquo;s little desk-table. I did not
notice the box afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you not see it there after Miss Cockermuth
left the room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I did not; not that I remember,&rdquo; answered
Sam. &ldquo;Truth to say, I never thought about it. My
attention was confined to the letter I was copying, to
the exclusion of everything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did any one come into the room after Miss
Cockermuth left it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one came into it. Somebody opened the door
and looked in.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>This was fresh news. The town hall pricked up its
ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know who it was,&rdquo; added Sam. &ldquo;My
head was bent over my writing, when the door opened
quickly, and as quickly shut again. I supposed somebody
had looked in to see if Mr. or Miss Cockermuth
was there, and had retreated on finding they were not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could that person, whomsoever it might be, have
advanced to the table and taken the box?&rdquo; asked the
chief of the magistrates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. For certain, no!&rdquo;&mdash;and Sam&rsquo;s tone here,
he best knew why, was aggravatingly defiant. &ldquo;The
person might have put his head in&mdash;and no doubt did&mdash;but
he did not set a foot inside the room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Cockermuth was asked about this: whether
he observed any one go to the parlour and look in.
He protested till he was nearly blue with rage (for
he regarded it as Sam&rsquo;s invention), that such a thing
never took place, that no one whatever went near the
parlour-door.</p>

<p>Next came up the question of the guinea, which
was hanging from his watch-guard, shining and bold
as if it had been brass. Sam had been questioned
about this by the justices on Thursday, and his statement
in answer to them was just as bold as the coin.</p>

<p>The guinea had been given him by his late father&rsquo;s
uncle, old Thomas Dene, who had jokingly enjoined
him never to change it, always to keep it by him, and
then he would never be without money. Sam had
kept it; kept it from that time to this. He kept it
in the pocket of an old-fashioned leather case, which
contained some letters from his father, and two or three
other things he valued. No, he was not in the habit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of getting the guinea out to look at, he had retorted
to a little badgering; had not looked at it (or at the
case either, which lay in the bottom of his trunk) for
months and months&mdash;yes, it might be years, for all
he recollected. But on the Tuesday evening, when
talking with Miss Parslet about guineas, he fetched it
to show to her; and slipped it into his pocket afterwards,
where, the police found it on the Thursday.
This was the substance of his first answer, and he
repeated it now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know who is said to be the father of lies,
young man?&rdquo; asked Justice Whitewicker in a solemn
tone, suspecting that the prisoner was telling an out-and-out
fable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; answered Sam. &ldquo;Have never seen
him myself. Perhaps you have, sir.&rdquo; At which a
titter went round the court, and it put his worship&rsquo;s
back up. Sam went on to say that he had often
thought of taking his guinea into wear, and had now
done it. And he gave the guinea a flick in the face
of us all.</p>

<p>Evidently little good could come of a hardened
criminal like this; and Justice Whitewicker, who
thought nothing on earth so grand as the sound of his
own voice from the bench, gave Sam a piece of his
mind. In the midst of this a stir arose at the appearance
of Maria Parslet. Mr. Chance led her in; her
father, sad and shrinking as usual, walked behind
them. Lawyer Cockermuth&mdash;and I liked him for it&mdash;made
a place for his clerk next to himself. Maria
looked modest, gentle and pretty. She wore black
silk, being in slight mourning, and a dainty white
bonnet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Dene was asked to take tea with them in the
parlour on the Tuesday evening, as a matter of convenience,
Maria&rsquo;s evidence ran, in answer to questions,
and she briefly alluded to the reason why. Whilst
waiting together, he and she, for her father to come
in, Mr. Dene told her of the finding of the ebony box
of guineas at Mr. Cockermuth&rsquo;s. She laughingly
remarked that a guinea was an out-of-date coin now,
and she was not sure that she had ever seen one. In
reply to that, Mr. Dene said he had one by him,
given him by an old uncle some years before; and he
went upstairs and brought it down to show to her.
There could be no mistake, Maria added to Mr. Whitewicker,
who wanted to insinuate a word of doubt, and
her sweet brown eyes were honest and true as she
said it; she had touched the guinea and held it in her
hand for some moments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Held it and touched it, did you, Miss Parslet?&rdquo;
retorted Lawyer Standup. &ldquo;Pray what appearance
had it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a thin, worn coin, sir,&rdquo; replied Maria;
&ldquo;thinner, I think, than a sovereign, but somewhat
larger; it seemed to be worn thin at the edge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose image was on it?&mdash;what king&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;George the Third&rsquo;s. I noticed that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you think, young lady, that the accused
took this marvellous coin from his pocket, instead of
from some receptacle above stairs?&rdquo; went on Mr.
Standup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite sure he did not take it from his pocket
when before me,&rdquo; answered Maria. &ldquo;He ran upstairs
quickly, saying he would fetch the guinea: he had
nothing in his hands then.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon this Lawyer Chance inquired of his learned
brother why he need waste time in useless questions;
begging to remind him that it was not until Wednesday
morning the box disappeared, so the prisoner could
not well have had any of its contents about him on
Tuesday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just let my questions alone, will you,&rdquo; retorted
Mr. Standup, with a nod. &ldquo;I know what I am about.
Now, Miss Parslet, please attend to me. Was the
guinea you profess to have seen a perfect coin, or was
there a hole in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a perfect coin, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what became of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Mr. Dene put it in his waistcoat-pocket:
I did not particularly notice. Quite close upon that,
my father came home, and we sat down to tea. No,
sir, nothing was said to my father about the guinea;
if it was, I did not hear it. But he and Mr. Dene
talked of the box of guineas that had been found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was it that called while you were at tea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young Mr. Chance called. We had finished tea
then, and Mr. Dene took him upstairs to his own
sitting-room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not asking you about young Mr. Chance;
we shall come to him presently,&rdquo; was the rough-toned,
but not ill-natured retort. &ldquo;Somebody else called:
who was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria, blushing and paling ever since she stood up
to the ordeal, grew white now. Mr. Badger had
called at the door, she answered, and Mr. Dene went
out to speak to him. Worried by Lawyer Standup
as to whether he did not come to ask for money, she
said she believed so, but she did not hear all they said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>Quiet Mr. Parslet was the next witness. He had
to acknowledge that he did hear it. Mr. Badger
appeared to be pressing for some money owing to
him; could not tell the amount, knew nothing about
that. When questioned whether the accused owed
him money, Parslet said not a shilling; Mr. Dene had
never sought to borrow of him, and had paid his
monthly accounts regularly.</p>

<p>Upon that, Mr. Badger was produced; a thin man
with a neck as stiff as a poker; who gave his
reluctant testimony in a sweet tone of benevolence.
Mr. Dene had been borrowing money from him for
some time; somewhere about twenty pounds, he
thought, was owing now, including interest. He had
repeatedly asked for its repayment, but only got put
off with (as he believed) lame excuses. Had certainly
gone to ask for it on the Tuesday evening; was
neither loud nor angry, oh dear, no; but did tell the
accused he thought he could give him some if he
would, and did say that he must have a portion of it
within a week, or he should apply to Mr. Jacobson, of
Elm Farm. Did not really mean to apply to Mr.
Jacobson, had no wish to do any one an injury, but
felt vexed at the young man&rsquo;s off-handedness, which
looked like indifference. Knew besides that Mr. Dene
had other debts.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ll leave you to judge how this evidence
struck on the ears of old Jacobson. He leaped to
the conclusion that Sam had been going all sorts of
ways, as he supposed he went when in London, and
might be owing, the mischief only knew how much
money; and he shook his fist at Sam across the
justice-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Standup next called young Chance, quite to
young Chance&rsquo;s surprise; perhaps also to his father&rsquo;s.
He was questioned upon no end of things&mdash;whether he
did not know that the accused was owing a great deal
of money, and whether the accused had shown any
guinea to him when he was in Edgar Street on the
Tuesday night. Austin answered that he believed
Mr. Dene owed a little money, not a great deal, so far
as he knew; and that he had not seen the guinea or
heard of it. And in saying all this, Austin&rsquo;s tone
was just as resentfully insolent to Mr. Standup as he
dared to make it.</p>

<p>Well, it is of no use to go on categorically with the
day&rsquo;s proceedings. When they came to an end, the
magistrates conferred pretty hotly in a low tone
amongst themselves, some apparently taking up one
opinion, as to Sam&rsquo;s guilt, or innocence, and some the
other. At length they announced their decision, and
it was as follows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although the case undoubtedly presents grave
grounds of suspicion against the accused, Samson
Reginald Dene&mdash;&lsquo;Very grave indeed,&rsquo; interjected Mr.
Whitewicker, solemnly&mdash;we do not consider them to
be sufficient to commit him for trial upon; therefore,
we give him the benefit of the doubt, and discharge
him. Should any further evidence transpire, he can
be brought up again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Maria Parslet&rsquo;s testimony about the guinea
that cleared him,&rdquo; whispered the crowd, as they filed
out.</p>

<p>And I think it must have been. It was just impossible
to doubt her truth, or the earnestness with
which she gave it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Jacobson &ldquo;interviewed&rdquo; Sam, as the Americans
say, and the interview was not a loving one. Being
in the mood, he said anything that came uppermost.
He forbade Sam to appear at Elm Farm ever again, as
&ldquo;long as oak and ash grew;&rdquo; and he added that as
Sam was bent on going to the deuce head foremost,
he might do it upon his own means, but that he&rsquo;d
never get any more help from him.</p>

<p>The way the Squire lashed up Bob and Blister when
driving home&mdash;for, liking Sam hitherto, he was just as
much put out as old Jacobson&mdash;and the duet they
kept together in abuse of his misdeeds, was edifying
to hear. Tod laughed; I did not. The gig was given
over this return journey to the two grooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not believe Sam took the box, sir,&rdquo; I said to
old Jacobson, interrupting a fiery oration.</p>

<p>He turned round to stare at me. &ldquo;What do you
say, Johnny Ludlow? <em>You do not believe he took the
box?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to me it seems quite plain that he did not
take it. I&rsquo;ve hardly ever felt more sure of anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plain!&rdquo; struck in the Squire. &ldquo;How is it plain,
Johnny? What grounds do you go upon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I judge by his looks and his tones, sir, when
denying it. They are to be trusted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did not know whether to laugh or scoff at me.
It was Johnny&rsquo;s way, said the Squire; always fancying
he could read the riddles in a man&rsquo;s face and voice.
But they&rsquo;d have thrown up their two best market-going
hats with glee to be able to think it true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Samson Reginald Dene was relieved of the charge,
as it was declared &ldquo;not proven;&rdquo; all the same, Samson
Reginald Dene was ruined. Worcester said so. During
the following week, which was Passion Week, its
citizens talked more of him than of their prayers.</p>

<p>Granted that Maria Parslet&rsquo;s testimony had been
honestly genuine, a theory cropped up to counteract
it. Lawyer Standup had been bold enough to start it
at the Saturday&rsquo;s examination: a hundred tongues
were repeating it now. Sam Dene, as may be remembered,
was present at the finding of the box on Tuesday;
he had come up the passage and touched the golden
guineas in it with the tips of his fingers; those fingers
might have deftly extracted one of the coins. No
wonder he could show it to Maria when he went home
to tea! Captain Cockermuth admitted that in counting
the guineas subsequently he had thought he counted
sixty; but, as he knew there were (or ought to be)
that number in the box, probably the assumption
misled him, causing him to reckon them as sixty when
in fact there were only fifty-nine. Which was a bit
of logic.</p>

<p>Still, popular opinion was divided. If part of the
town judged Sam to be guilty, part believed him to be
innocent. A good deal might be said on both sides.
To a young man who does not know how to pay his
debts from lack of means, and debts that he is afraid
of, too, sixty golden guineas may be a great temptation;
and people did not shut their eyes to that. It transpired
also that Mr. Jacobson, his own uncle, his best friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
had altogether cast Sam off and told him he might now
go to the dogs his own way.</p>

<p>Sam resented it all bitterly, and defied the world.
Far from giving in or showing any sense of shame, he
walked about with an air, his head up, and that brazen
guinea dangling in front of him. He actually had the
face to appear at college on Good Friday (the congregation
looking askance at him), and sat out the cold
service of the day: no singing, no organ, and the little
chorister-boys in black surplices instead of white ones.</p>

<p>But the crowning act of boldness was to come. Before
Easter week had lapsed into the past, Sam Dene had
taken two rooms in a conspicuous part of the town
and set-up in practice. A big brass plate on the outer
door displayed his name: &ldquo;Mr. Dene, Attorney-at-law.&rdquo;
Sam&rsquo;s friends extolled his courage; Sam&rsquo;s
enemies were amazed at his impudence. Captain
Cockermuth prophesied that the ceiling of that office
would come tumbling down on its crafty occupant&rsquo;s
head: it was <em>his</em> gold that was paying for it.</p>

<p>The Cockermuths, like the town, were divided in
opinion. Mr. Cockermuth could not believe Sam
guilty, although the mystery as to where the box could
be puzzled him as few things had ever puzzled him in
this life. He would fain have taken Sam back again,
had it been a right thing to do. What the captain
thought need not be enlarged upon. While Miss
Betty felt uncertain; veering now to this belief, now
to that, and much distressed either way.</p>

<p>There is one friend in this world that hardly ever
deserts us&mdash;and that is a mother. Mrs. Dene, a pretty
little woman yet, had come flying to Worcester, ready
to fight everybody in it on her son&rsquo;s behalf. Sam of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
course made his own tale good to her; whether it was
a true one or not he alone knew, but not an angel
from heaven could have stirred her faith in it. She
declared that, to her positive knowledge, the old uncle
had given Sam the guinea.</p>

<p>It was understood to be Mrs. Dene who advanced
the money to Sam to set up with; it was certainly
Mrs. Dene who bought a shutting-up bed (at old
Ward&rsquo;s), and a gridiron, and a tea-pot, and a three-legged
table, and a chair or two, all for the back-room
of the little office, that Sam might go into housekeeping
on his own account, and live upon sixpence
a-day, so to say, until business came in. To look at
Sam&rsquo;s hopeful face, he meant to do it, and to live down
the scandal.</p>

<p>Looking at the thing impartially, one might perhaps
see that Sam was not swayed by impudence in setting-up,
so much as by obligation. For what else lay open
to him?&mdash;no firm would engage him as clerk with
that doubt sticking to his coat-tails. He paid some
of his debts, and undertook to pay the rest before the
year was out. A whisper arose that it was Mrs.
Dene who managed this. Sam&rsquo;s adversaries knew
better; the funds came out of the ebony box: that,
as Charles Cockermuth demonstrated, was as sure as
heaven.</p>

<p>But now there occurred one thing that I, Johnny
Ludlow, could not understand, and never shall: why
Worcester should have turned its back, like an angry
drake, upon Maria Parslet. The school, where she was
resident teacher, wrote her a cool, polite note, to say
she need not trouble herself to return after the Easter
recess. That example was followed. Pious individuals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
looked upon her as a possible story-teller, in
danger of going to the bad in Sam&rsquo;s defence, nearly as
much as Sam had gone.</p>

<p>It was just a craze. Even Charles Cockermuth
said there was no sense in blaming Maria: of course
Sam had deceived her (when pretending to show the
guinea as his own), just as he deceived other people.
Next the town called her &ldquo;bold&rdquo; for standing up in
the face and eyes of the Guildhall to give her evidence.
But how could Maria help that? It was not her own
choice: she&rsquo;d rather have locked herself up in the
cellar. Lawyer Chance had burst in upon her that
Saturday morning (not ten minutes after we left the
house), giving nobody warning, and carried her off
imperatively, never saying &ldquo;Will you, or Won&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;
It was not his way.</p>

<p>Placid Miss Betty was indignant when the injustice
came to her ears. What did people mean by it? she
wanted to know. She sent for Maria to spend the
next Sunday in Foregate Street, and marched with
her arm-in-arm to church (St. Nicholas&rsquo;), morning and
evening.</p>

<p>As the days and the weeks passed, commotion gave
place to a calm; Sam and his delinquencies were let
alone. One cannot be on the grumble for ever. Sam&rsquo;s
lines were pretty hard; practice held itself aloof from
him; and if he did not live upon the sixpence a-day,
he looked at every halfpenny that he had to spend
beyond it. His face grew thin, his blue eyes wistful,
but he smiled hopefully.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You keep up young Dene&rsquo;s acquaintance, I perceive,&rdquo;
remarked Lawyer Chance to his son one evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
as they were finishing dinner, for he had met the
two young men together that day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes: why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; returned Austin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think that charge was a mistaken one, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well I do, father. He has affirmed it to me in
terms so unmistakable that I can but believe him.
Besides, I don&rsquo;t think Dene, as I have always said,
is the sort of fellow to turn rogue: I don&rsquo;t, indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he get any practice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very little, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Chance was a man with a conscience. On the
whole, he felt inclined to think Sam had not helped
himself to the guineas, but he was by no means sure
of it: like Miss Betty Cockermuth, his opinion veered,
now on this side, now on that, like a haunted weathercock.
If Sam was not guilty, why, then, Fate had
dealt hardly with the young fellow&mdash;and what would
the end be? These thoughts were running through
the lawyer&rsquo;s mind as he talked to his son and sat
playing with his bunch of seals, which hung down by
a short, thick gold chain, in the old-fashioned manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to say a word to him if he&rsquo;d come to
me,&rdquo; he suddenly cried. &ldquo;You might go and bring
him, Austin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;this evening?&rdquo; exclaimed Austin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay; why not? One time&rsquo;s as good as another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Austin Chance started off promptly for the new
office, and found his friend presiding over his own tea-tray
in the little back-room; the loaf and butter on
the table, and a red herring on the gridiron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t time to get any dinner to-day; too busy,&rdquo;
was Sam&rsquo;s apology, given briefly with a flush of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
face. &ldquo;Mr. Chance wants me? Well, I&rsquo;ll come.
What is it for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Austin. And away they
went.</p>

<p>The lawyer was standing at the window, his hands
in the pockets of his pepper-and-salt trousers, tinkling
the shillings and sixpences there. Austin supposed
he was not wanted, and shut them in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking of your case a good bit
lately, Sam Dene,&rdquo; began Mr. Chance, giving Sam a
seat and sitting down himself; &ldquo;and I should like to
feel, if I can, more at a certainty about it, one way or
the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam. And you must please to
note that manners in those days had not degenerated
to what they are in these. Young men, whether
gentle or simple, addressed their elders with respect;
young women also. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;But
what do you mean about wishing to feel more at a
certainty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I defended you before the magistrates, I did
my best to convince them that you were not guilty:
you had assured me you were not: and they discharged
you. I believe my arguments and my pleadings went
some way with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt of it, sir, and I thanked you at
the time with all my heart,&rdquo; said Sam warmly. &ldquo;Some
of my enemies were bitter enough against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you should not speak in that way&mdash;calling
people your enemies!&rdquo; reproved the lawyer. &ldquo;People
were only at enmity with you on the score of the
offence. Look here, Sam Dene&mdash;did you commit it, or
did you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>Sam stared. Mr. Chance had dropped his voice to
a solemn key, his head was pushed forward, gravity
sat on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The short answer did not satisfy the lawyer. &ldquo;Did
you filch that box of guineas out of Cockermuth&rsquo;s
room; or were you, and are you, as you assert, wholly
innocent?&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;Tell me the truth as before
Heaven. Whatever it be, I will shield you still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam rose. &ldquo;On my sacred word, sir, and before
Heaven, I have told nothing but the truth. I did not
take or touch the box of guineas. I do not know
what became of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Chance regarded Sam in silence. He had
known young men, when under a cloud, prevaricate
in a most extraordinary and unblushing manner: to
look at them and listen to them, one might have said
they were fit to be canonized. But he thought truth
lay with Sam now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, sit down, Dene,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am glad
to believe you. Where the deuce could the box have
got to? It could not take flight through the ceiling
up to the clouds, or down to the earth through the
floor. <em>Whose hands took it?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The box went in one of two ways,&rdquo; returned Sam.
&ldquo;If the captain did not fetch it out unconsciously, and
lose it in the street, why, somebody must have entered
the parlour after I left it and carried off the box.
Perhaps the individual who looked into the room
when I was sitting there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pity but you had noticed who that was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. Look here, Mr. Chance; a thought has
more than once struck me&mdash;if that person did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
come back and take the box, why has he not come
forward openly and honestly to avow it was himself
who looked in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer gave his head a dissenting shake. &ldquo;It
is a ticklish thing to be mixed up in, he may think,
one that he had best keep out of&mdash;though he may be
innocent as the day. How are you getting on?&rdquo; he
asked, passing abruptly from the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, middling,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;As well, perhaps,
as I could expect to get on at first, with all the
prejudice abroad against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Earning bread-and-cheese?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, see here, Dene&mdash;and this is what I chiefly
sent for you to say, if you could assure me on your
conscience you deserved it&mdash;I may be able to put
some little business in your hands. Petty matters are
brought to us that we hardly care to waste time upon:
I&rsquo;ll send them to you in future. I dare say you&rsquo;ll be
able to rub on by dint of patience. Rome was not
built in a day, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir; I thank you very truly,&rdquo; breathed
Sam. &ldquo;Mr. Cockermuth sent me a small matter the
other day. If I can make a bare living of it at present,
that&rsquo;s all I ask. Fame and fortune are not rained
down upon black sheep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which was so true a remark as to need no contradiction.</p>

<p>May was nearing its close then, and the summer
evenings were long and lovely. As Sam went forth
from the interview, he thought he would take a walk
by the river, instead of turning in to his solitary
rooms. Since entering upon them he had been as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
steady as old Time: the accusation and its attendant
shame seemed to have converted him from a heedless,
youthful man into a wise old sage of age and care.
Passing down Broad Street towards the bridge, he
turned to the left and sauntered along beside the
Severn. The water glittered in the light of the setting
sun; barges, some of them bearing men and women
and children, passed smoothly up and down on it; the
opposite fields, towards St. John&rsquo;s, were green as an
emerald: all things seemed to wear an aspect of
brightness.</p>

<p>All on a sudden things grew brighter&mdash;and Sam&rsquo;s
pulses gave a leap. He had passed the grand old red-stoned
wall that enclosed the Bishop&rsquo;s palace, and
was close upon the gates leading up to the Green,
when a young lady turned out of them and came
towards him with a light, quick step. It was Maria
Parslet, in a pretty summer muslin, a straw hat
shading her blushing face. For it did blush furiously
at sight of Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dene!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maria!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She began to say, hurriedly, that her mother had
sent her with a message to the dressmaker on the
Parade, and she had taken that way, as being the
shortest&mdash;as if in apology for having met Sam.</p>

<p>He turned with her, and they paced slowly along
side by side, the colour on Maria&rsquo;s cheeks coming and
going with every word he spoke and every look he
gave her&mdash;which seemed altogether senseless and
unreasonable. Sam told her of his conversation with
Austin Chance&rsquo;s father, and his promise to put a few
things in his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Once let me be making two hundred a-year, Maria,
and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; questioned Maria innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I should ask you to come to me, and we&rsquo;d
risk it together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Risk what?&rdquo; stammered Maria, turning her head
right round to watch a barge that was being towed
by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Risk our luck. Two hundred a-year is not so bad
to begin upon. I should take the floor above as well
as the ground-floor I rent now, and we should get
along. Any way, I hope to try it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Dene!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t &lsquo;Mr. Dene&rsquo; me, young lady, if you
please. Why, Maria, what else can we do? A mean,
malicious set of dogs and cats have turned their backs
upon us both; the least we should do is to see if we
can&rsquo;t do without them. I know you&rsquo;d rather come to
me than stay in Edgar Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria held her tongue, as to whether she would or
not. &ldquo;Mamma is negotiating to get me a situation at
Cheltenham,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not go to Cheltenham, or anywhere else,
if I get any luck,&rdquo; he replied dictatorially. &ldquo;Life
would look very blue to me now without you, Maria.
And many a man and wife, rolling in riches at the
end, have rubbed on with less than two hundred a-year
at the beginning. I wouldn&rsquo;t say, mind, but we might
risk it on a hundred and fifty. My rent is low, you
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;es,&rdquo; stammered Maria &ldquo;But&mdash;I wish that
mystery of the guineas could be cleared up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam stood still, turned, and faced her. &ldquo;Why do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
you say <em>that</em>? You are not suspecting that I took
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, <strong>NO</strong>,&rdquo; returned Maria, losing her breath.
&ldquo;I <em>know</em> you did not take them: could not. I was
only thinking of your practice: so much more would
come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cockermuth has sent me a small matter or two.
I think I shall get on,&rdquo; repeated Sam.</p>

<p>They were at their journey&rsquo;s end by that time, at
the dressmaker&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo; said Maria,
timidly holding out her hand.</p>

<p>Sam Dene took it and clasped it. &ldquo;Good-bye, my
darling. I am going home to my bread-and-cheese
supper, and I wish you were there to eat it with me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria sighed. She wondered whether that wonderful
state of things would ever come to pass. Perhaps
no; perhaps yes. Meanwhile no living soul knew
aught of these treasonable aspirations; they were a
secret between her and Sam. Mr. and Mrs. Parslet
suspected nothing.</p>

<p>Time went on. Lawyer Chance was as good as his
word, and put a few small matters of business into the
hands of Sam Dene. Mr. Cockermuth did the same.
The town came down upon him for it; though it let
Chance alone, who was not the sort of man to be
dictated to. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cockermuth in answer, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe the lad is guilty; never have believed it.
Had he been of a dishonest turn, he could have helped
himself before, for a good deal of my cash passed at
times through his hands. And, given that he was
innocent, he has been hardly dealt by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam Dene was grateful for these stray windfalls,
and returned his best thanks to the lawyers for them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
But they did not amount to much in the aggregate;
and a gloomy vision began to present itself to his
apprehension of being forced to give up the struggle,
and wandering out in the world to seek a better
fortune. The summer assizes drew near. Sam had no
grand cause to come on at them, or small one either;
but it was impossible not to give a thought now and
again to what his fate might have been, had he stood
committed to take his trial at them. The popular
voice said that was only what he merited.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The assizes were held, and passed. One hot day, when
July was nearing its meridian, word was brought to
Miss Cockermuth&mdash;who was charitable&mdash;that a poor
sick woman whom she befriended, was worse than
usual, so she put on her bonnet and cloak to pay her a
visit. The bonnet was a huge Leghorn, which shaded
her face well from the sun, its trimming of straw
colour; and the cloak was of thin black &ldquo;taffeta,&rdquo;
edged with narrow lace. It was a long walk on a hot
afternoon, for the sick woman lived but just on this
side Henwick. Miss Betty had got as far as the bridge,
and was about to cross it when Sam Dene, coming
over it at a strapping pace, ran against her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Betty brought her bonnet from under the
shade of her large grass-green parasol. &ldquo;Dear me, is
it you, Sam Dene?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Were you walking
for a wager?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>Sam laughed a little. &ldquo;I was hastening back to
my office, Miss Betty. I have no clerk, you know,
and a client <em>might</em> come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Betty gave her head a twist, something between
a nod and a shake; she noticed the doubtful tone in
the &ldquo;might.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very hot, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going up to see that poor Hester Knowles; she&rsquo;s
uncommon bad, I hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a warm walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay. Are you pretty well, Sam? You look thin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I? Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing but the heat of the
weather. I am quite well, thank you. Good-afternoon,
Miss Betty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook his hand heartily. One of Sam&rsquo;s worst
enemies, who might have run in a curricle with
Charles Cockermuth, as to an out-and-out belief in his
guilt, was passing at the moment, and saw it.</p>

<p>Miss Betty crossed the bridge, turned off into
Turkey, for it was through those classical regions that
her nearest and coolest way lay, and so onwards to
the sick woman&rsquo;s room. There she found the blazing
July sun streaming in at the wide window, which
had no blind, no shelter whatever from it. Miss
Betty had had enough of the sun out-of-doors, without
having it in. Done up with the walk and the heat,
she sat down on the first chair, and felt ready to
swoon right off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Hester, this is bad for you!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you mean the sun, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked the sick
woman, who was sitting full in it, wrapped in a
blanket or two. &ldquo;It is a little hot just now, but I
don&rsquo;t grumble at it; I&rsquo;m so cold mostly. As soon as
the sun goes off the window, I shall begin to shiver.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well-a-day!&rdquo; responded Miss Betty, wishing she
could be cool enough to shiver. &ldquo;But if you feel it
cold now, Hester, what will you do when the autumn
winds come on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, ma&rsquo;am, please do not talk of it! I just can&rsquo;t
tell what I shall do. That window don&rsquo;t fit tight,
and the way the wind pours in through it upon me
as I sit here at evening, or lie in my little bed there,
passes belief. I&rsquo;m coughing always then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have some good thick curtains put
up,&rdquo; said Miss Betty, gazing at the bare window,
which had a pot of musk on its sill. &ldquo;Woollen ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sick woman smiled sadly. She was very poor
now, though it had not always been so; she might as
well have hoped to buy the sun itself as woollen
curtains&mdash;or cotton curtains either. Miss Betty knew
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it, Hester, and see if I&rsquo;ve any
old ones that I could let you have. I&rsquo;m not sure;
but I&rsquo;ll look,&rdquo; repeated she&mdash;and began to empty her
capacious dimity pockets of a few items of good things
she had brought.</p>

<p>By-and-by, when she was a little cooler, and had
talked with Hester, Miss Betty set off home again,
her mind running upon the half-promised curtains.
&ldquo;They are properly shabby,&rdquo; thought she, as she went
along, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;ll serve to keep the sun and the
wind off her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was thinking of those warm green curtains
that she had picked the braid from that past disastrous
morning&mdash;as the reader heard of, and all the town as
well. Nothing had been done with them since.</p>

<p>Getting home, Miss Betty turned into the parlour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Susan&mdash;who had not yet found leisure to fix any time
for her wedding&mdash;found her mistress fanning her hot
face, her bonnet untied and tilted back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to see that poor Hester Knowles, Susan,&rdquo;
began Miss Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Law, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; interposed Susan. &ldquo;What a walk
for you this scorching afternoon! All up that wide
New Road!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may well say that, girl: but I went Turkey
away. She&rsquo;s very ill, poor thing; and that&rsquo;s a frightfully
staring window of hers, the sun on it like a
blazing fire, and not as much as a rag for a blind;
and the window don&rsquo;t fit, she says, and in cold
weather the biting wind comes in and shivers her up.
I think I might give her those shabby old curtains,
Susan&mdash;that were up in Mr. Philip&rsquo;s room, you know,
before we got the new chintz ones in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you might, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Susan, who was not a
bad-hearted girl, excepting to the baker&rsquo;s man. &ldquo;They
can&rsquo;t go up at any of our windows as they be; and if
you had &rsquo;em dyed, I don&rsquo;t know as they&rsquo;d answer
much, being so shabby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I put them&mdash;let me see&mdash;into the spare ottoman,
didn&rsquo;t I? Yes, that was it. And there I suppose
they must be lying still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure enough, Miss Betty,&rdquo; said Susan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not
touched &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Miss Betty. &ldquo;With all the trouble
that got into our house at that time, I couldn&rsquo;t give
my mind to seeing after the old things, and I&rsquo;ve not
thought about them since. Come upstairs with me
now, Susan; we&rsquo;ll see what sort of a state they
are in.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>They went up; and Miss Betty took off her bonnet
and cloak and put her cap on. The spare ottoman,
soft, and red, and ancient, used as a receptacle for
odds and ends that were not wanted, stood in a
spacious linen-closet on the first-floor landing. It
was built out over the back-door, and had a skylight
above. Susan threw back the lid of the ottoman, and
Miss Betty stood by. The faded old brown curtains,
green once, lay in a heap at one end, just as Miss
Betty had hastily flung them in that past day in
March, when on her way to look at the chintzes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in a fine rabble, seemingly,&rdquo; observed
Susan, pausing to regard the curtains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; cried Miss Betty, conscience-stricken,
for she was a careful housewife, &ldquo;I let them drop in
any way, I remember. I did mean to have them
well shaken out-of-doors and properly folded, but that
bother drove it all out of my head. Take them out,
girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Susan put her strong arms underneath the heap
and lifted it out with a fling. Something heavy flew
out of the curtains, and dropped on the boarded floor
with a crash. Letting fall the curtains, Susan gave a
wild shriek of terror and Miss Betty gave a wilder,
for the floor was suddenly covered with shining gold
coins. Mr. Cockermuth, passing across the passage
below at the moment, heard the cries, wondered
whether the house was on fire, and came hastening
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he coolly, taking in the aspect of affairs.
&ldquo;So the thief was you, Betty, after all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He picked up the ebony box, and bent his head to
look at the guineas. Miss Betty sank down on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
three-legged stool&mdash;brought in for Philip&rsquo;s children&mdash;and
grew as white as death.</p>

<p>Yes, it was the missing box of guineas, come to
light in the same extraordinary and unexpected
manner that it had come before, without having been
(as may be said) truly lost. When Miss Betty
gathered her curtains off the dining-room table that
March morning, a cumbersome and weighty heap, she
had unwittingly gathered up the box with them. No
wonder Sam Dene had not seen the box on the table
after Miss Betty&rsquo;s departure! It was a grievous misfortune,
though, that he failed to take notice it was
not there.</p>

<p>She had no idea she was not speaking truth in
saying she saw the box on the table as she left the
room. Having seen the box there all the morning she
thought it was there still, and that she saw it, being
quite unconscious that it was in her arms. Susan,
too, had noticed the box on the table when she opened
the door to call her mistress, and believed she was
correct in saying she saw it there to the last: the
real fact being that she had not observed it was gone.
So there the box with its golden freight had lain
undisturbed, hidden in the folds of the curtains. But
for Hester Knowles&rsquo;s defective window, it might have
stayed there still, who can say how long?</p>

<p>Susan, no less scared than her mistress, stood back
against the closet wall for safety, out of reach of those
diabolical coins; Miss Betty, groaning and half-fainting
on the three-legged stool, sat pushing back her cap
and her front. The lawyer picked up the guineas and
counted them as he laid them flat in the box. Sixty
of them: not one missing. So Sam&rsquo;s guinea <em>was</em> his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
own! He had not, as Worcester whispered, trumped
up the story with Maria Parslet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; gasped poor Miss Betty, beside herself with
remorse and terror, &ldquo;John, what will become of me
now? Will anything be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How &lsquo;done&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will they bring me to trial&mdash;or anything of that&mdash;in
poor Sam&rsquo;s place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered her brother grimly;
&ldquo;perhaps not this time. But I&rsquo;d have you take more
care in future, Betty, than to hide away gold in old
curtains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Locking the box securely within his iron safe, Mr.
Cockermuth put on his hat and went down to the
town hall, where the magistrates, after dispensing
their wisdom, were about to disperse for the day. He
told them of the wonderful recovery of the box of
guineas, of how it had been lost, and that Sam Dene
was wholly innocent. Their worships were of course
charmed to hear it, Mr. Whitewicker observing that
they had only judged Sam by appearances, and that
appearances had been sufficient (in theory) to hang
him.</p>

<p>From the town hall, Mr. Cockermuth turned off to
Sam&rsquo;s office. Sam was making a great show of business,
surrounded by a tableful of imposing parchments,
but with never a client to the fore. His old master
grasped his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sam, my boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the tables have
turned for you. That box of guineas is found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam never spoke an answering word. His lips
parted with expectation: his breath seemed to be a
little short.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty had got it all the time. She managed somehow
to pick it up off the table with those wretched
old curtains she had there, all unconsciously, of course,
and it has lain hidden with the curtains upstairs in
a lumber-box ever since. Betty will never forgive
herself. She&rsquo;ll have a fit of the jaundice over this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam drew a long breath. &ldquo;You will let the public
know, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, Sam, without loss of an hour. I&rsquo;ve begun
with the magistrates&mdash;and a fine sensation the news
made amidst &rsquo;em, I can tell you; and now I&rsquo;m going
round to the newspapers; and I shall go over to Elm
Farm the first thing to-morrow. The town took up
the cause against you, Sam: take care it does not eat
you now in its repentance. Look here, you&rsquo;ll have
to come round to Betty, or she&rsquo;ll moan her heart out:
you won&rsquo;t bear malice, Sam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Sam warmly. &ldquo;Miss Betty
did not bear it to me. She has been as kind as can
be all along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The town did want to eat Sam. It is the custom
of the true Briton to go to extremes. Being unable to
shake Sam&rsquo;s hands quite off, the city would fain have
chaired him round the streets with honours, as it used
to chair its newly returned members.</p>

<p>Captain Cockermuth, sent for post haste, came to
Worcester all contrition, beseeching Sam to forgive
him fifty times a-day, and wanting to press the box
of guineas upon him as a peace-offering. Sam would
not take it: he laughingly told the captain that the
box did not seem to carry luck with it.</p>

<p>And then Sam&rsquo;s troubles were over. And no objection
was made by his people (as it otherwise might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
have been) to his marrying Maria Parslet, by way of
recompense. &ldquo;God never fails to bring good out of
evil, my dear,&rdquo; said old Mrs. Jacobson to Maria, the
first time they had her on a visit at Elm Farm. As
to Sam, he had short time for Elm Farm, or anything
else in the shape of recreation. Practice was
flowing in quickly: litigants arguing, one with another,
that a young man, lying for months under an imputation
of theft, and then coming out of it with flying
colours, must needs be a clever lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Johnny,&rdquo; Sam said to me, when talking of the
past, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s one thing I would alter if I made the
laws. No person, so long as he is only suspected of
crime, should have his name proclaimed publicly. I
am not speaking of murder, you understand, or charges
of that grave nature; but of such a case as mine. My
name appeared in full, in all the local newspapers,
Samson Reginald Dene, coupled with theft, and of
course it got a mark upon it. It is an awful blight
upon a man when he is innocent, one that he may
never quite live down. Suspicions must arise, I know
that, of the innocent as well as the guilty, and they
must undergo preliminary examinations in public and
submit to legal inquiries: but time enough to proclaim
who the man is when evidence strengthens against
him, and he is committed for trial; until then let his
name be suppressed. At least that is my opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And it is mine as well as Sam&rsquo;s.</p>

<h2>OUR FIRST TERM AT OXFORD.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>It was Friday night at the Oxford terminus, and all
the world scrambling for cabs. Sir John and the
Squire, nearly lifted off their legs, and too much
taken aback to fight for themselves, stood against
the wall, thinking the community had gone suddenly
mad. Bill Whitney and Tod, tall, strong young
fellows, able to hold their own anywhere, secured a
cab at length, and we and our luggage got in and
on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the Mitre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this is a specimen of Oxford manners, the sooner
the lads are at home the better,&rdquo; growled the Squire.
Sir John Whitney was settling his spectacles on his
nose&mdash;nearly lost off it in the scuffle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snepp told me it was a regular shindy at the
terminus the first day of term, with all the students
coming back,&rdquo; said Bill Whitney.</p>

<p>There had been no end of discussion as to our
college career. Sir John Whitney said William must
go to Oxford, as he had been at Oxford himself;
whereas Brandon stood out against Oxford for me;
would not hear of it. He preferred Cambridge he
said: and to Cambridge Johnny Ludlow should go:
and he, as my guardian, had full power over me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
The Squire cared not which university was chosen;
but Tod went in for Oxford with all his strong will:
he said the boating was best there. The result was
that Mr. Brandon gave way, and we were entered at
Christchurch.</p>

<p>Mr. Brandon had me at his house for two days
beforehand, giving me counsel. He had one of his
bad colds just then and kept his room, and his voice
was never more squeaky. The last evening, I sat up
there with him while he sipped his broth. The fire
was large enough to roast us, and he had three flannel
night-caps on. It was that night that he talked to me
most. He believed with all his heart, he said, that
the temptations to young men were greater at Oxford
than at Cambridge; that, of the two, the more reckless
set of men were there: and that was one of the
reasons why he had objected to Oxford for me. And
then he proceeded to put the temptations pretty
strongly before me, and did not mince things, warning
me that it would require all the mental and moral
strength I possessed to resist them, and steer clear of
a course of sin and shame. He then suddenly opened
the Bible, which was on the table at his elbow, and
read out a line or two from the thirtieth chapter of
Deuteronomy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See, I have set before you this day life and good,
and death and evil: therefore choose life, that both
thou and thy seed may live.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I have been striving to set before
you, Johnny Ludlow. Read that chapter, the whole
of it, often; treasure its precepts in your heart; and
may God give you grace to keep them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook hands with me in silence. I took up my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
candle and waited a moment, for I thought he was
going to speak again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you try to keep them, lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were fortunate in getting good rooms at Christchurch.
Tod&rsquo;s and mine were close together; Bill
Whitney&rsquo;s on the floor above. Our sitting-room was
pleasant; it had an old cracked piano in it, which
turned out to be passably fair when it had been
tinkered and tuned. The windows looked out on the
trees of the Broad Walk and to the meadows beyond;
but trees are bare in winter, and the month was
January. I had never stayed at Oxford before: and
I saw that I should like it, with its fine, grand old
colleges. The day after we got there, Saturday, we
wrote our names in the dean&rsquo;s book, and saw our
tutor. The rest of the day was spent in seeing about
battels and getting into the new ways. Very new to
us. A civil young fellow, who waited on us as scout,
was useful; they called him &ldquo;Charley&rdquo; in the college.
Tod pulled a long face at some of the rules, and did
not like the prospect of unlimited work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go in for the boating and fishing and driving,
Johnny; and you can go in for the books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Tod.&rdquo; I knew what he meant. It was
not that he did not intend to take a fair amount of
work: but to exist without a good share of out-of-door
life also, would have been hard lines for Tod.</p>

<p>The Sunday services were beautiful. The first
Sunday of term was a high day, and the cathedral
was filled. Orders of admission to the public were
not necessary that day, and a general congregation
mixed with the students. Sir John and the Squire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
were staying at the Mitre until Monday. After
service we went to promenade in the Broad Walk&mdash;and
it seemed that everybody else went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look there!&rdquo; cried the Squire, &ldquo;at this tall clergyman
coming along. I am sure he is one of the canons
of Worcester.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Mr. Fortescue&mdash;Honourable and Reverend.
He halted for a minute to exchange greetings with
Sir John Whitney, whom he knew, and then passed
on his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some pretty girls about, too,&rdquo; resumed the
Squire, gazing around. &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;d advise you
boys to look much at them. Wonder if they often
walk here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before a week had gone by, we were quite at home;
had shaken down into our new life as passengers shake
down in their places in an omnibus; and made lots of
friends. Some I liked; some I did not like. There
was one fellow always coming in&mdash;a tall dark man
with crisp hair; his name Richardson. He had plenty
of money and kept dogs and horses, and seemed to go
in for every kind of fast life the place afforded. Of
work he did none; and report ran that he was being
watched by the proctor, with whom he was generally
in hot water. Altogether he was not in good odour:
and he had a way of mocking at religion as though
he were an atheist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard a bit about Richardson just now,&rdquo; cried
Whitney, one morning that he had brought his
commons in to breakfast with us&mdash;and the fields outside
were white with snow. &ldquo;Mayhew says he&rsquo;s a
scamp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s much else, myself,&rdquo; said Tod.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
&ldquo;I say, just taste this butter! It&rsquo;s shockingly strong.
Wonder what it is made of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mayhew says he&rsquo;s a liar as well as a villain.
There&rsquo;s no speaking after him. Last term a miserable
affair occurred in the town; the authorities could not
trace it home to Richardson though they suspected he
was the black sheep. Lots of fellows knew he was:
but he denied it out-and-out. I think we had better
not have much to do with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He entertains jolly well,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;Johnny,
you&rsquo;ve boiled these eggs too hard. And his funds
seem to spring from some perpetual gold mine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door opened, and two bull-dogs burst in,
leaping and howling. Richardson&mdash;they were his&mdash;followed,
with little Ford; the latter a quiet, inoffensive
man, who stuck to his work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, you two devils!&rdquo; cried Richardson,
kicking his dogs. &ldquo;Lie down, will you? I say, I&rsquo;ve
a wine-coach on to-night in my rooms, after Hall.
Shall be glad to see you all at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Considering the conversation he had broken in
upon, none of us had a very ready answer at hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heaps of letters to answer to-night, and
must do it,&rdquo; said Whitney. &ldquo;Thank you all the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Richardson might have read coolness in the tone; I
don&rsquo;t know; but he turned the back of his chair on
Bill to face Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not letters to write, I suppose, Todhetley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I. I leave letters to Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tod candidly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mean to go in
for wine-parties.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Richardson. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell another tale
when you&rsquo;ve been here a bit longer. <em>Will</em> you be
still, you brutes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;Wine plays the very
mischief with work. Should never get any done if I
went in for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you intend to go up for honours?&rdquo; went on
Richardson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twould be a signal failure if I did. I leave all
that to Ludlow&mdash;as I said by the letters. See to the
dogs, Richardson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The animals had struck up a fight. Richardson
secured the one and sent the other out with a kick.
Our scout was coming in, and the dog flew at him.
No damage; but a great row.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charley,&rdquo; cried Tod, &ldquo;this butter&rsquo;s not fit to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not, sir? What&rsquo;s the matter with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The matter with it?&mdash;everything&rsquo;s the matter
with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is <em>that</em> your scout?&rdquo; asked Richardson, when the
man had gone again, holding his dog between his
knees as he sat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;And your dogs all but made
mincemeat of him. You should teach them better
manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serve him right if they had. His name&rsquo;s Tasson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tasson, is it? We call him Charley here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. He&rsquo;s a queer one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is he queer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s pious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pious,&rdquo; repeated Richardson, twisting his mouth.
&ldquo;A saint; a cant; a sneak.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; cried Bill Whitney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m jesting! Ask Ford here. Tell it,
Ford.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Ford: &ldquo;true that he goes in for
piety. Last term there was a freshman here named
Carstairs. He was young; rather soft; no experience,
you know, and he began to go the pace. One night
this Charley, his scout, fell on his knees, and besought
him with tears not to go to the bad; to pull up in
time and remember what the end must be; and&mdash;and
so on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Carstairs do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do! why turned him out,&rdquo; put in Richardson.
&ldquo;Carstairs, by the way, has taken his name off the
books, or <em>had</em> to take it off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charley is civil and obliging to us,&rdquo; said Whitney.
&ldquo;Never presumes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How much of the tale was gospel we knew not;
but for my own part, I liked Charley. There was
something about him quite different from scouts and
servants in general&mdash;and by the way, I don&rsquo;t think
Charley was a scout, only a scout&rsquo;s help&mdash;but in
appearance and diction and manner he was really
superior. A slim, slight young fellow of twenty, with
straight fine light hair and blue eyes, and a round spot
of scarlet on his thin cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Charley, they say you are pious,&rdquo; began
Bill Whitney that same day after lecture, when the
man was bringing in the bread-and-cheese from the
buttery.</p>

<p>He coloured to the roots of his light hair, and did
not answer. Bill never minded what he said to any
one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You were scout to Mr. Carstairs. Did you take
his morals under your special protection?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Whitney,&rdquo; said Tod in an undertone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And constitute yourself his guardian-angel-in-ordinary?
Didn&rsquo;t you go down on your knees to
him with tears and sobs, and beseech him not to go
to the bad?&rdquo; went on Bill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a word of truth in it, sir. One evening
when Mr. Carstairs was lying on his sofa, tired
and ill&mdash;for he was beginning to lead a life that had
no rest in it, hardly, day or night, a folded slip of
paper was brought in from Mr. Richardson, and Mr.
Carstairs bade me read it to him. It was to remind
him of some appointment for the night. Mr. Carstairs
was silent for a minute, and then burst out with a
kind of sharp cry, painful to hear. &lsquo;By Heaven, if
this goes on, they&rsquo;ll ruin me, body and soul! I&rsquo;ve a
great mind not to go.&rsquo; I did speak then, sir; I told
him he was ill, and had better stay at home; and I
said that it was easy enough for him to pull up then,
but that when one got too far on the down-hill path
it was more difficult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo; cried Whitney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every word, sir. I should not have spoken at all
but that I had known Mr. Carstairs before we came
here. Mr. Richardson made a great deal of it, and
gave it quite a different colouring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Mr. Carstairs turn you away for that?&rdquo; I
asked of Charley; when he came back for the things,
and the other two had gone out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three or four days after it happened, sir, Mr.
Carstairs stopped my waiting on him again. I
think it was through Mr. Richardson. Mr. Carstairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
had refused to go out with him the evening it
occurred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You knew Mr. Carstairs before he came to Oxford.
Where was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated, and then went on. &ldquo;It
was at the school he was at in London, sir. I was a
junior master there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letting a plate fall&mdash;for I was helping to pack them,
wanting the table&mdash;I stared at the fellow. &ldquo;A master
there and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and a servant here, I all but said, but
I stopped the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one of the outer masters, attending daily,&rdquo;
he went on quietly. &ldquo;I taught writing and arithmetic,
and English to the juniors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how comes it that you are here in this post,
Charley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had reasons for wishing to come to live at Oxford,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why not have sought out something better
than this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did seek, sir. But nothing of the kind was to
be had, and this place offered. There&rsquo;s many a one,
sir, falls into the wrong post in life, and can never
afterwards get into the right one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;do you&mdash;like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Like</em> it, sir; no! But I make a living at it. One
thing I shall be always grateful to Mr. Carstairs for:
that he did not mention where he had known me. I
should not like it to be talked of in the college, especially
by Mr. Richardson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He disappeared with his tray as he spoke. It
sounded quite mysterious. But I took the hint, and
said nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>The matter passed. Charley did not put on any
mentorship to us, and the more we saw of him the
more we liked him. But an impression gradually
dawned upon us that he was not strong enough for
his place. Carrying a heavy tray upstairs would set
him panting like an old man, and he could not run
far or fast.</p>

<p>One day I was hard at work, Tod and Whitney
being off somewhere, driving tandem, when a queer,
ugly-sounding cough kept annoying me from outside:
but whether it came from dog or man I could not tell.
Opening the door at last, there sat Charley on the
stairs, his head resting against the wall, and his cheeks
brighter than a red leaf in autumn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, is it you, Charley? Where did you pick
up that cough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said he, starting up. &ldquo;I
thought your rooms were empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in till the fit&rsquo;s over. You are in a regular
draught there. Come along,&rdquo; for he hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;I
want to shut the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came in, coughing finely, and I gave him the
chair by the fire. It was nothing, he said, and would
soon be gone. He had caught it a day or two back in
the bleak east wind: the college was draughty, and he
had to be on the run out-of-doors in all sorts of
weather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, Charley, putting east winds and
draughts aside, you don&rsquo;t seem to be quite up to your
work here in point of strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was up to it, sir, when I took it. It&rsquo;s a failing
in some of our family, sir, to have weak lungs. I
shall be all right again, soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>The coughing was over, and he got up to go away,
evidently not liking to intrude. There was a degree
of sensitiveness about him that, of itself, might have
shown he was superior to his position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a good jorum of treacle-posset, Charley, at
bed-time.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>Spring weather came in with February. The biting
cold and snow of January disappeared, and genial
sunshine warmed the earth again. The first Sunday
in this same February month, from my place at morning
service, looking out on the townsfolk who had
come in with orders, I saw a lady, very little and
pretty, staring fixedly at me from afar. The face&mdash;where
had I seen her face? It seemed familiar, but I
could not tell how or where I had known it. A small
slight face of almost an ivory white, and wide-open
light blue eyes that had plenty of confidence in them.</p>

<p>Sophie Chalk! I should have recognized her at the
first moment but for the different mode in which her
hair was dressed. Wonderful hair! A vast amount
of it, and made the most of. She wore it its natural
colour to-day, brown, and the red tinge on it shone
like burnished gold. She knew me; that was certain;
and I could not help watching her. Her eyes went
roving away presently, possibly in search of Tod. I
stole a glance at him; but he did not appear to see
her. What brought her to Oxford?</p>

<p>We got out of church. I took care to hold my
tongue. Tod had cared for Sophie Chalk&mdash;there could
be little doubt of it&mdash;as one never cares for anybody
again in life: and it might be just as well&mdash;in spite
of the exposé of mademoiselle&rsquo;s false ways and misdoings&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
they did not meet. Syrens are syrens
all the world over.</p>

<p>The day went on to a bright moonlight night. Tod
and I, out for a stroll, were standing within the shade
of the fine old Magdalen Tower, talking to a fellow of
Trinity, when there came up a lady of delicate presence,
the flowers in her bonnet exhaling a faint odour of
perfume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>think</em> I am not mistaken&mdash;I am sure&mdash;yes, I <em>am</em>
sure it is Mr. Ludlow. And&mdash;surely that cannot be
Mr. Todhetley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod wheeled round at the soft, false voice. The
daintily gloved hand was held out to him; the fair,
false face was bent close: and his own face turned red
and white with emotion. I saw it even in the shade
of the moonlight. Had she been strolling about to
look for us? Most likely. A few moments more, and
we were all three walking onwards together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only fancy my position!&rdquo; she gaily said. &ldquo;Here
am I, all forlorn, set down alone in this great town,
and must take care of myself as I best can. The
formidable gowns and caps frighten me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gowns and caps will do you no harm&mdash;Miss
Chalk,&rdquo; cried Tod&mdash;and he only just saved himself
from saying &ldquo;Sophie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think not,&rdquo; she returned, touching the
sleeve of her velvet jacket, as if to brush off a fly.
&ldquo;But I beg you will accord me my due style and title,
Mr. Todhetley, and honour me accordingly. I am no
longer Miss Chalk. I am Mrs. Everty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she had married Mr. Everty after all! She
minced along between us in her silk gown, her hands
in her ermine muff that looked made for a doll. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the private door of a shop in High Street she halted,
rang the bell, and threw the door open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will walk up and take a cup of tea with me.
Nay, but you must&mdash;or I shall think you want to hold
yourselves above poor little me, now you are grand
Oxford men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went along the passage and up the stairs:
there seemed no resource but to follow. In the sitting-room,
which was very well furnished and looked
out upon the street, a fire burned brightly; and a
lamp and tea-things stood on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&mdash;keeping me waiting for
my tea in this way! You never think of any one but
yourself: never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The querulous complaint, and thin, shrill voice came
from a small dark girl who sat at the window, peering
out into the lighted street. I had not forgotten the
sharp-featured sallow face and the deep-set eyes. It
was Mabel Smith, the poor little lame and deformed
girl I had seen in Torriana Square. She really did not
look much older or bigger, and she spoke as abruptly
as ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember you, Johnny Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Everty made the tea. Her dress, white one
way, green the other, gleamed like silver in the lamplight.
It had a quantity of white lace upon it: light
green ribbons were twisted in her hair. &ldquo;I should
think it would be better to have those curtains drawn,
Mabel. Your tea&rsquo;s ready: if you will come to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I choose to have the curtains open and I&rsquo;ll
take my tea here,&rdquo; answered Mabel. &ldquo;You may be
going out again for hours, and what company should
I have but the street? I don&rsquo;t like to be shut up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
in a strange room: I might see ghosts. Johnny
Ludlow, that&rsquo;s a little coffee-table by the wall: if
you&rsquo;ll put it here it will hold my cup and saucer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I put it near her with her tea and plate of bread-and-butter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit by me? I am very lonely. Those
other two can talk to one another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I carried my cup and sat down by Mabel. The
&ldquo;other two,&rdquo; as Mabel put it, were talking and laughing.
Tod was taking a lesson in tea-making from her, and
she called him awkward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you living here?&rdquo; I asked of Mabel under
cover of the noise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Living here! no,&rdquo; she replied in her old abrupt
fashion. &ldquo;Do you think papa would let me be living
over a shop in Oxford? My grandmamma lives near
the town, and she invited me down on a visit to her.
There was no one to bring me, and she said <em>she</em> would&rdquo;&mdash;indicating
Sophie&mdash;&ldquo;and we came yesterday. Well,
would you believe it? Grandmamma had meant <em>next</em>
Saturday, and she could not take us in, having visitors
already. I wanted to go back home; but she said she
liked the look of Oxford, and she took these rooms for
a week. Two guineas without fires and other extras:
I call it dear. How came she to find you out,
Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We met just now. She tells us she is Mrs. Everty
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, they are married. And a nice bargain
Mr. Everty has in her! Her dresses must cost twenty
pounds apiece. Some of them <em>thirty</em> pounds! Look
at the lace on that one. Mrs. Smith, papa&rsquo;s wife,
gives her a good talking-to sometimes, telling her Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
Everty&rsquo;s income won&rsquo;t stand it. I should think it
would not!&mdash;though I fancy he has a small share in
papa&rsquo;s business now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they live in London?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, they live in London. Close to us, too!
In one of the small houses in Torriana Street. <em>She</em>
wanted to take a large house in the square like ours,
but Mr. Everty was too wise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Talking to this girl, my thoughts back in the past,
I wondered whether Sophie&rsquo;s people had heard of the
abstraction of Miss Deveen&rsquo;s emeralds. But it was
not likely. To look at her now: watching her
fascinating ease, listening to her innocent reminiscences
of the time we had all spent together at Lady Whitney&rsquo;s,
I might have supposed she had taken a dose of the
waters of Lethe, and that Sophie Chalk had always
been guileless as a child; an angel without wings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has lost none of her impudence, Tod,&rdquo; I said
as we went home. &ldquo;In the old days, you know, we
used to say she&rsquo;d fascinate the hair off our heads, give
her the chance. She&rsquo;d wile off both ears as well now.
A good thing she&rsquo;s married!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod broke into a whistle, and went striding on.</p>

<p>Before the week was out, Sophie Chalk&mdash;we
generally called her by the old name&mdash;had become
intimate with some of the men of different colleges.
Mabel Smith went to her grandmother&rsquo;s, and Sophie
had nothing to do but exhibit her charms in the
Oxford streets and entertain her friends. The time
went on. Hardly an evening passed but Tod was
there; Bill Whitney went sometimes; I rarely. Sophie
did not fascinate me, whatever she might do by others.
Sophie treated her guests to wine and spirits, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
unlimited packs of cards. Bill Whitney said one night
in a joking way that he was not sure but she might
be indicted for keeping a private gaming-house.
Richardson was one of her frequent evening visitors,
and she would let him take his bull-dogs to make a
morning call. There would be betting over the cards
in the evenings, and she did not attempt to object.
Sophie would not play herself; she dispersed her
fascinations amidst the company while they played, and
sang songs at the piano&mdash;one of the best pianos to be
found in Oxford. There set in a kind of furore for
pretty Mrs. Everty; the men who had the entrée there
went wild over her charms, and vied with each other
in making her costly presents. Sophie broke into
raptures of delight over each with the seeming simplicity
of a child, and swept all into her capacious net.</p>

<p>I think it was receiving those presents that was
keeping her in Oxford; or helping to keep her.
Some of them were valuable. Very valuable indeed
was a set of diamonds, brooch and ear-rings, that soft
young calf, Gaiton, brought her; but what few brains
the viscount had were clean dazzled away by Sophie&rsquo;s
attractions: and Richardson gave her a bejewelled fan
that must have cost a small fortune. If Sophie Chalk
did spend her husband&rsquo;s money, she was augmenting
her stock of precious stones&mdash;and she had not lost her
passion for them.</p>

<p>One morning my breakfast was brought in by a
strange fellow, gloomy and grim. Tod had gone to
breakfast with Mayhew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Charley?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sick,&rdquo; was the short answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Down with a cold, or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And we had this surly servant for ever so long
to come: and I&rsquo;m sorry to say got so accustomed
to seeing his face as to forget sick Charley.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Will you go up the river for a row, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The questioner was Bill Whitney; who had come
in to look for Tod. I had nothing particular on hand
that afternoon, and the skies were blue and the sun
golden. So we went down to the river together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where has Tod got to?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness knows. I&rsquo;ve not seen him since lecture
this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We rowed up to Godstowe. Bill disappeared with
some friend of his from Merton&rsquo;s, who had watched us
put in. I strolled about. Every one knows the dark
pool of water there. On the bench under the foliage,
so thick in summer, but bare yet in this early season,
warm and sunny though it was, sat a man wrapped
in a great-coat, whom I took at first to be a skeleton
with painted cheeks. But one does not care to stare
at skeletons, knowing they&rsquo;d help their looks if they
could; and I was passing him with my face turned
the other way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-afternoon, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned at the hollow words&mdash;hollow in sound as
though they came out of a drum. It was Charley:
the red paint on his thin cheeks was nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
natural hectic, and the blue of his eyes shone painfully
bright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, Charley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fly-man, who had to drive here and back,
brought me with him for a mouthful of fresh air, it
being so warm and bright. It is the first time I have
been able to get out, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are poorly, Charley.&rdquo; I had all but said
&ldquo;dying.&rdquo; But one can only be complimentary to a
poor fellow in that condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very ill I have been, sir; but I&rsquo;m better. At one
time I never thought I should get up again. It&rsquo;s this
beautiful warm weather coming in so early that has
restored me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about restored? You don&rsquo;t look
great things yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have seen me a short while ago, sir!
I&rsquo;m getting on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lying by his side, on a piece of paper, was a thick
slice, doubled, of bread-and-butter, that he must have
brought with him. He broke a piece off, and ate it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look hungry, Charley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of it, sir; I&rsquo;m always hungry,&rdquo; he
answered, and his tone from its eagerness was quite
painful to hear, and his eyes grew moist, and the
hectic spread on his cheeks. &ldquo;It is the nature of the
complaint, I&rsquo;m told: and poor mother was the same.
I could be eating and drinking every hour, sir, and
hardly be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along to the inn, and have some tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; no, thank you,&rdquo; he said, shrinking back.
&ldquo;I answered your remark thoughtlessly, sir, for it&rsquo;s
the truth; not with any notion that it would make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
you ask me to take anything. And I&rsquo;ve got some
bread-and-butter here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Going indoors, I told them to serve him a good tea,
with a big dish of bacon and eggs, or some relishing
thing of that sort. Whitney came in and heard me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You be hanged, Johnny! We are not going in for
all that, here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for us, Bill; it&rsquo;s for that poor old scout,
Charley. He&rsquo;s as surely dying as that you and I are
talking. Come and look at him: you never saw such
an object. I don&rsquo;t believe he gets enough to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whitney came, and did nothing but stare. Charley
went indoors with a good deal of pressing, and we
saw him sit down to the feast. Whitney stayed; I
went out-of-doors again.</p>

<p>I remembered a similar case. It was that of a
young woman who used to make Lena&rsquo;s frocks. She
fell into a decline. Her appetite was wonderful.
Anything good and substantial to eat and drink, she
was always craving for: and it all seemed to do her
no good. Charley Tasson&rsquo;s sickness must be of the
same nature. She died: and he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I was struck dumb! Seated on the bench under
the trees, my thoughts back in that past time, there
came two figures over the rustic bridge. A lady and
gentleman, arm-in-arm: she in a hat and blue feather
and dainty lace parasol; and he with bent head and
words softened to a whisper. Tod!&mdash;and Sophie
Chalk!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! There&rsquo;s Johnny Ludlow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She loosed his arm as she spoke, and came sailing
up to me, her gold bracelets jingling as she gave her
hand. I don&rsquo;t believe there are ten women in England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
who could get themselves up as effectively as did
Sophie Chalk. Tod looked black as thunder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the devil brings you here, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rowed up with Whitney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A pause. &ldquo;Who else is here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forbes of Merton: Whitney has been about with
him. And I suppose a few others. We noticed a
skiff or two waiting. Perhaps one was yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I spoke indifferently, determined he should not
know I was put out. Seeing him there&mdash;I was going
to say on the sly&mdash;with that beguiling syren, who
was to foretell what pitfalls she might charm him
into? He took Madame Sophie on his arm again to
continue their promenade, and I lost sight of them.</p>

<p>I did not like it. It was not satisfactory. He had
rowed her up&mdash;or perhaps driven her up&mdash;and was
marching about with her tête-à-tête under the sweet
spring sunshine. No great harm in itself this pastime:
but he might grow too fond of it. That she had reacquired
all her strong influence over Tod&rsquo;s heart was
clear as the stars on a frosty night. Whitney called
out to me that it was time to think of going back.
I got into the boat with him, saying nothing.</p>

<p>Charley told me where he lived&mdash;&ldquo;Up Stagg&rsquo;s
Entry&rdquo;&mdash;for I said I would call to see him. Just for
a day or two there seemed to be no time; but I got
there one evening when Tod had gone to the syren&rsquo;s.
It was a dark, dusky place, this Stagg&rsquo;s Entry, and,
I think, is done away with now, with several houses
crowded into it. Asking for Charles Tasson, of a
tidy, motherly woman on the stairs, she went before
me, and threw open a door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a gentleman to see you, Mr. Charley.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>He was lying in a bed at the end of the room near
the fire, under the lean-to roof. If I had been shocked
at seeing him in the open air, in the glad sunshine, I
was doubly so now in the dim light of the tallow
candle. He rose in bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you to come here, sir! I&rsquo;m sure
I didn&rsquo;t expect you to remember it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you worse, Charley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I caught a fresh cold, sir, that day at Godstowe.
And I&rsquo;m as weak as a rat too&mdash;hardly able to creep
out of bed. Nanny, bring a chair for this gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the handiest little girls I ever saw, with the
same shining blue eyes that he had, and plump, pretty
cheeks, laid hold of a chair. I took it from her and
sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this your sister, Charley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. There&rsquo;s only us two left together. We
were eight of us once. Three went abroad, and one
is in London, and two dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What doctor sees you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One comes in now and then, sir. My illness is not
much in a doctor&rsquo;s way. There&rsquo;s nothing he could
do: nothing for me but to wait patiently for summer
weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you had to eat to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had two eggs for his dinner: I boiled them,&rdquo;
said little Nanny. &ldquo;And Mrs. Cann brought us in
six herrings, and I cooked one for tea; and he&rsquo;ll have
some ale and bread-and-butter for supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke like a little important housekeeper. But
I wondered whether Charley was badly off.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cann, the same woman who had spoken to me,
came out of her room opposite as I was going away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
She followed me downstairs, and began to talk in an
undertone. &ldquo;A sad thing, ain&rsquo;t it, sir, to see him
a-lying there so helpless; and to know that it has laid
hold of him for good and all. He caught it from his
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She died here in that room, just as the winter
come in, with the same complaint&mdash;decline they call
it; and he waited on her and nursed her, and must
have caught it of her. A good son he was. They
were well off once, sir, but the father just brought &rsquo;em
to beggary; and Charley&mdash;he had a good education of
his own&mdash;came down from London when his mother
got ill, and looked out for something to do here that
he might stay with her. At first he couldn&rsquo;t find
anything; and when he was at a sore pinch, he took
a place at Christchurch College as scout&rsquo;s helper. He
had to pocket his pride: but there was Nanny as well
as his mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d been teacher in a school up in London, sir,
by day, and in the evenings he used to help some
young clergyman as scripture-reader to the poor in
one of them crowded parishes we hear tell of: he was
always one for trying to do what good he could.
Naturally he&rsquo;d be disheartened at falling to be a bed-maker
in a college, and I&rsquo;m afraid the work was too
hard for him: but, as I say, he was a good son. The
mother settled in Oxford after her misfortunes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is he supported now? And the little girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not over much of a support,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cann
with disparagement. &ldquo;Not for him, that&rsquo;s a-craving
for meat and drink every hour. The eldest brother is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
in business in London, sir, and he sends them what
they have. Perhaps he&rsquo;s not able to do more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not late. I thought I would, for once, pay
Mrs. Everty a visit. A run of three minutes, and I
was at her door.</p>

<p>They were there&mdash;the usual set. Tod, and Richardson,
and Lord Gaiton, and the two men from Magdalen,
and&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s no use enumerating&mdash;seven or eight
in all. Richardson and another were quarrelling at
écarté, four were at whist; Tod was sitting apart with
Sophie Chalk.</p>

<p>She was got up like a fairy at the play, in a
cloud of thin white muslin; her hair hanging around
and sparkling with gold dust, and little gleams of
gold ornaments shining about her. If ever Joseph
Todhetley had need to pray against falling into
temptation, it was during the weeks of that unlucky
term.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is quite an honour, Johnny Ludlow,&rdquo; said
Madame Sophie, rising to meet me, her eyes sparkling
with what might have been taken for the most hearty
welcome. &ldquo;It is not often you honour my poor little
room, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not often I can find the time for it, Mrs.
Everty. Tod, I came in to see whether you were
ready to go in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at his watch hastily, fearing it might be
later than it was; and answered curtly and coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready?&mdash;no. I have not had my revenge yet at
écarté.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Approaching the écarté table, he sat down. Mrs.
Everty drew a chair behind Lord Gaiton, and looked
over his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>The days passed. I had two cares on my mind,
and they bothered me. The one was Tod and his
dangerous infatuation; the other, poor dying Charley
Tasson. Tod was losing frightfully at those card-tables.
Night after night it went on. Tod&rsquo;s steps
were drawn thither by a fascination irresistible: and
whether the cards or their mistress were the more
subtle potion for him, or what was to be the ending of
it all, no living being could tell.</p>

<p>As to Stagg&rsquo;s Entry, my visits to it had grown
nearly as much into a habit as Tod&rsquo;s had to High
Street. When I stayed away for a night, little Nanny
would whisper to me the next that Charley had not
taken his eyes off the door. Sick people always like
to see visitors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him want for anything, Johnny,&rdquo; said
Tod. &ldquo;The pater would blow us up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The time ran on, and the sands of Charley&rsquo;s life ran
with it. One Wednesday evening upon going in late,
and not having many minutes to stay, I found him on
the bed in a dead faint, and the candle guttering in
the socket. Nanny was nowhere. I went across the
passage to Mrs. Cann&rsquo;s, and she was nowhere. It was
an awkward situation; for I declare that for the
moment I thought he was gone.</p>

<p>Knowing most of Nanny&rsquo;s household secrets, I
looked in the candle-box for a fresh candle. Charley
was stirring then, and I gave him some wine. He
had had a similar fainting-fit at mid-day, he said,
which had frightened them, and Nanny had fetched
the doctor. She was gone now, he supposed, to fetch
some medicine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the end, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>He asked it quite calmly. I could not tell: but to
judge by his wan face I thought it might be. And
my time was up and more than up: and neither
Nanny nor Mrs. Cann came. The wine revived him
and he seemed better; quite well again: well, for him.
But I did not like to leave him alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you mind reading to me, sir?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I read, Charley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be for the last time, sir. I&rsquo;d like to hear
the service for the burial of the dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I read it every word, the long lesson, and all.
Nanny came in before it was finished, medicine in
hand, and sat down in silence with her bonnet on.
She had been kept at the doctor&rsquo;s. Mrs. Cann was
the next to make her appearance, having been abroad
on some business of her own: and I got away when
it was close upon midnight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your name and college, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ludlow. Christchurch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the proctor. He had pounced full upon me
as I was racing home. And the clocks were striking
twelve!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ludlow&mdash;Christchurch,&rdquo; he repeated, nodding his
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to be out so late, sir, against rules,
but I could not help it. I have been sitting with a
sick man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said he blandly; &ldquo;you can tell that
to-morrow to the dean. Home to your quarters
now, if you please, Mr. Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I knew he believed me just as much as he
would had I told him I&rsquo;d been up in a balloon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a nice lot, Master Johnny!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>The salutation was Tod&rsquo;s. He and Bill Whitney
were sitting over the fire in our room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help being late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not! As to late&mdash;it&rsquo;s only midnight.
Next time you&rsquo;ll come in with the milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jest. I&rsquo;ve been with that poor Charley,
and I think he&rsquo;s dying. The worst of it is, the
proctor has just dropped upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; It sobered them both, and they put aside
their mockery. Bill, who had the tongs in his hand,
let them go down with a crash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thousand pities, Johnny. Not one of us has
been before the dean yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can only tell the dean the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if he&rsquo;d believe you! By Jupiter! Once get
one of our names up, and those proctors will track
every step of the ground we tread on. They watch a
marked man as a starving cat watches a mouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the morning came in the requisition for me
to attend before the dean. When I got there, who
should be stealing out of the room quite sheepishly,
his face down and his ears red, but Gaiton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it your turn, Ludlow!&rdquo; he cried, closing the
room-door as softly as though the dean had been asleep
inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you been had up for, Gaiton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. I got knocking about a bit last
night, for Mrs. Everty did not receive, and came
across that confounded proctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the dean in a hard humour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard enough, and be hanged to him! It&rsquo;s not the
dean: he&rsquo;s ill, or something; perhaps been making a
night of it himself: and Applerigg&rsquo;s on duty for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
Dry old scarecrow! For two pins, Ludlow, I&rsquo;d take
my name off the books, and be free of the lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Applerigg had the reputation of being one of
the strictest of college dons. He was like a maypole,
just as tall and thin, with a long, sallow face, and
enough learning to set up the reputations of three
archbishops for life. The doctor was marching up
and down the room in his college-cap, and turned his
spectacles on me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut the door, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I did as I was bid, he sat down at an open
desk near the fire and looked at a paper that had
some writing on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What age may you be, Mr. Ludlow?&rdquo; he sternly
asked, when a question or two had passed. And I
told him my age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! And don&rsquo;t you think it a very disreputable
thing, a great <em>discredit</em>, sir, for a young fellow of your
years to be found abroad by your proctor at midnight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I could not help being late, sir, last night;
and I was not abroad for any purpose of pleasure. I
had been staying with a poor fellow who is sick;
dying, in fact: and&mdash;and it was not my fault, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care, young man,&rdquo; said he, glaring through
his spectacles. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I can never forgive
if deliberately told me, and that&rsquo;s a lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be sorry to tell a lie, sir,&rdquo; I answered:
and by the annoyance so visible in his looks and tones,
it was impossible to help fancying he had found out,
or thought he had found out, Gaiton in one. &ldquo;What
I have said is truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go over again what you did say,&rdquo; cried he, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
shortly, after looking at his paper again and then
hard at me. And I went over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>What</em> do you say the man&rsquo;s name is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charles Tasson, sir. He was our scout until he
fell ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray do you make a point, Mr. Ludlow, of visiting
all the scouts and their friends who may happen to
fall sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; I said, uneasily, for there was ridicule in
his tone, and I knew he did not believe a word. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t suppose I should ever have thought of visiting
Tasson, but for seeing him look so ill one afternoon
up at Godstowe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be very ill to be at Godstowe!&rdquo; cried
Dr. Applerigg. &ldquo;Very!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was so ill, sir, that I thought he was dying
then. Some flyman he knew had driven him to
Godstowe for the sake of the air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s your <em>motive</em>, may I ask, for going to
sit with him?&rdquo; He had a way of laying emphasis on
certain of his words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no motive, sir: except that he is lonely
and dying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor looked at me for what seemed ten
minutes. &ldquo;What is this sick man&rsquo;s address, pray?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him the address in Stagg&rsquo;s Entry; and he
wrote it down, telling me to present myself again
before him the following morning.</p>

<p>That day, I met Sophie Chalk; her husband was
with her. She nodded and seemed gay as air: he
looked dark and sullen as he took off his hat. I
carried the news into college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sophie Chalk has her husband down, Tod.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Queen Anne&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; retorted he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you knew it!&rdquo; And I might have guessed
that he did by his not having spent the past evening
in High Street, but in a fellow&rsquo;s rooms at Oriel. And
he was as cross as two sticks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a <em>fool</em> she must have been to go and throw
herself away upon that low fellow Everty!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
putting his shoulders against the mantelpiece
and stamping on the carpet with one heel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw herself away! Well, Tod, opinions vary.
<em>I</em> think she was lucky to get him. As to his being
low, we don&rsquo;t know that he is. Putting aside that
one mysterious episode of his being down at our place
in hiding, which I suppose we shall never come to the
bottom of, we know nothing of what Everty has, or
has not been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shut up, Johnny. Common sense is common
sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everty&rsquo;s being here&mdash;we can&rsquo;t associate with him,
you know, Tod&mdash;affords a good opportunity for breaking
off the visits to High Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who wants to break off the visits to High Street?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, for one. Madame Sophie&rsquo;s is a dangerous
atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dangerous for you, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it. <em>You</em> know. Be wise in time, old
fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of all the muffs living, Johnny, you are about the
greatest. In the old days you feared I might go in
for marrying Sophie Chalk. I don&rsquo;t see what you can
fear now. Do you suppose I should run away with
another man&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Tod!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what else is it? Come! Out with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think our people or the Whitneys would
like it if they knew we are intimate with her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d not die of it, I expect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like her, Tod. It is not a nice thing of her
to allow the play and the betting, and to have all
those fellows there when they choose to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod took his shoulder from the mantelpiece, and
sat down to his imposition: one he had to write
for having missed chapel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean well, Johnny, though you are a muff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later in the day I met Dr. Applerigg. He signed
to me to stop. &ldquo;Mr. Ludlow, I find that what you
told me this morning was true. And I withdraw
every word of condemnation that I spoke. I wish I
had never greater cause to find fault than I have with
you, in regard to this matter. Not that I can sanction
your being out so late, although the plea of excuse <em>be</em>
a dying man. You understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. It shall not occur again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down at the house in Stagg&rsquo;s Entry, that evening,
Mrs. Cann met me on the stairs. &ldquo;One of the great
college doctors was here to-day, sir. He came up
asking all manner of questions about you&mdash;whether
you&rsquo;d been here till a&rsquo;most midnight yesterday, and
what you&rsquo;d stayed so late for, and&mdash;and all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Applerigg! &ldquo;What did you tell him, Mrs.
Cann?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him, sir! what should I tell him but the
truth? That you had stayed here late because of
Charley&rsquo;s being took worse and nobody with him, and
had read the burial service to him for his asking; and
that you came most evenings, and was just as good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
to him as gold. He said he&rsquo;d see Charley for himself
then; and he went in and talked to him, oh so gently
and nicely about his soul; and gave little Nanny half-a-crown
when he went away. Sometimes it happens,
sir, that those who look to have the hardest faces have
the gentlest hearts. And Charley&rsquo;s dying, sir. He
was took worse again this evening at five o&rsquo;clock, and
I hardly thought he&rsquo;d have lasted till now. The doctor
has been, and thinks he&rsquo;ll go off quietly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quietly perhaps in one sense, but it was a restless
death-bed. He was not still a minute; but he was
quite sensible and calm. Waking up out of a doze
when I went in, he held out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nearly over, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was sure of that, and sat down in silence. There
could be no mistaking his looks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just had a strange dream,&rdquo; he whispered,
between his laboured breath; and his eyes were wet
with tears, and he looked curiously agitated. &ldquo;I
thought I saw mother. It was in a wide place, all
light and sunshine, too beautiful for anything but
heaven. Mother was looking at me; I seemed to be
outside in dulness and darkness, and not to know
how to get in. Others that I&rsquo;ve known in my lifetime,
and who have gone on before, were there, as well as
mother; they all looked happy, and there was a soft
strain of music, like nothing I ever heard in this
world. All at once, as I was wondering how I could
get in, my sins seemed to rise up before me in a great
cloud; I turned sick, thinking of them; for I knew
no sinful person might enter there. Then I saw One
standing on the brink! it could only have been
Jesus; and He held out His hand to me and smiled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
&lsquo;I am here to wash out your sins,&rsquo; He said, and I
thought He touched me with His finger; and oh, the
feeling of delight that came over me, of repose, of
bliss, for I knew that all earth&rsquo;s troubles were over,
and I had passed into rest and peace for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nanny came up, and gave him one or two spoonfuls
of wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it was a dream,&rdquo; he said, after a
pause. &ldquo;I think it was sent to show me what it is I
am entering on; to uphold me through the darksome
valley of the shadow of death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother said she should be watching for us, you
know, Charley,&rdquo; said the child.</p>

<p>A restless fit came over him again, and he stirred
uneasily. When it had passed, he was still for awhile
and then looked up at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the new heaven and the new earth, sir,
that we are told of in the Revelation. Would you
mind, sir&mdash;just those few verses&mdash;reading them to me
for the last time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nanny brought the Bible, and put the candle on
the stand, and I read what he asked for&mdash;the first few
verses of the twenty-first chapter. The little girl
kneeled down by the bed and joined her hands
together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Nanny,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;Put the
candle back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I did not tell all my dream,&rdquo; he resumed;
&ldquo;not quite all. As I passed over into heaven, I
thought I looked down here again. I could see the
places in the world; I could see this same Oxford
city. I saw the men here in it, sir, at their cards and
their dice and their drink; at all their thoughtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
folly. Spending their days and nights without a care
for the end, without as much as thinking whether
they need a Saviour or not. And oh, their condition
troubled me! I seemed to understand all things
plainly then, sir. And I thought if they would but
once lift up their hearts to Him, even in the midst of
their sin, He would take care of them even then, and
save them from it in the end&mdash;for He was tempted
Himself once, and knows how sore their temptations
are. In my distress, I tried to call out and tell them
this, and it awoke me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think he ought to talk, sir?&rdquo; whispered
Nanny. But nothing more could harm him now.</p>

<p>My time was up, and I ought to be going. Poor
Charley spoke so imploringly&mdash;almost as though the
thought of it startled him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, sir; not yet! Stay a bit longer with
me. It is for the last time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I stayed: in spite of my word passed to Dr.
Applerigg. It seems to me a solemn thing to cross
the wishes of the dying.</p>

<p>So the clock went ticking on. Mrs. Cann stole in
and out, and a lodger from below came in and looked
at him. Before twelve all was over.</p>

<p>I went hastening home, not much caring whether
the proctor met me again, or whether he didn&rsquo;t, for in
any case I must go to Dr. Applerigg in the morning,
and tell him I had broken my promise to him, and
why. Close at the gates some one overtook and
passed me.</p>

<p>It was Tod. Tod with a white face, and his hair
damp with running. He had come from Sophie
Chalk&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Tod?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laid my hand upon his arm in speaking. He
threw it off with a word that was very like an
imprecation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>is</em> the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil&rsquo;s the matter. Mind your own business,
Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been quarrelling with Everty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everty be hanged! The man has betaken himself
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much have you lost to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cleaned-out, lad. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We got to our room in silence. Tod turned over
some cards that lay on the table, and trimmed the
candle from a thief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tasson&rsquo;s dead, Tod.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good thing if some of us were dead,&rdquo; was the
answer. And he turned into his chamber and bolted
the door.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Lunch-time at Oxford, and a sunny day. Instead of
college and our usual fare, bread-and-cheese from the
buttery, we were looking on the High Street from
Mrs. Everty&rsquo;s rooms, and about to sit down to a snow-white
damasked table with no end of good things
upon it. Madam Sophie had invited four or five of
us to lunch with her.</p>

<p>The term had gone on, and Easter was not far off.
Tod had not worked much: just enough to keep him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
out of hot-water. His mind ran on Sophie Chalk
more than it did on lectures and chapel. He and the
other fellows who were caught by her fascinations
mostly spent their spare time there. Sophie dispersed
her smiles pretty equally, but Tod contrived to get
the largest share. The difference was this: they had
lost their heads to her and Tod his heart. The evening
card-playing did not flag, and the stakes played
for were high. Tod and Gaiton were the general
losers: a run of ill-luck had set in from the first for
both of them. Gaiton might afford this, but Tod
could not.</p>

<p>Tod had his moments of reflection. He&rsquo;d sit sometimes
for an hour together, his head bent down,
whistling softly to himself some slow dolorous
strain, and pulling at his dark whiskers; no doubt
pondering the question of what was to be the upshot
of it all. For my part, I devoutly wished Sophie
Chalk had been caught up into the moon before an
ill-wind had wafted her to Oxford. It was an awful
shame of her husband to let her stay on there, turning
the under-graduates&rsquo; brains. Perhaps he could
not help it.</p>

<p>We sat down to table: Sophie at its head in a
fresh-looking pink gown and bracelets and nicknacks.
Lord Gaiton and Tod sat on either side of her;
Richardson was at the foot, and Fred Temple and
I faced each other. What fit of politeness had
taken Sophie to invite me, I could not imagine.
Possibly she thought I should be sure to refuse; but
I did not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So kind of you all to honour my poor little table!&rdquo;
said Sophie, as we sat down. &ldquo;Being in lodgings, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
cannot treat you as I should wish. It is all cold:
chickens, meat-patties, lobster-salad, and bread-and-cheese.
Lord Gaiton, this is sherry by you, I think.
Mr. Richardson, you like porter, I know: there is
some on the chiffonier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We plunged into the dishes without ceremony, each
one according to his taste, and the lunch progressed.
I may as well mention one thing&mdash;that there was
nothing in Mrs. Everty&rsquo;s manners at any time to take
exception to: never a word was heard from her, never
a look seen, that could offend even an old dowager.
She made the most of her charms and her general
fascinations, and flirted quietly; but all in a lady-like
way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, yes; I think I will take a little more
salad, Mr. Richardson,&rdquo; she said to him with a beaming
smile. &ldquo;It is my dinner, you know. I have not a
hall to dine in to-night, as you gentlemen have. I
am sorry to trouble you, Mr. Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was holding her plate for Richardson. There
happened at that moment to be a lull in the talking,
and we heard a carriage of some kind stop at the
door, and a loud peal at the house-bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that brother of mine,&rdquo; said Fred Temple. &ldquo;He
bothered me to drive out to some confounded place
with him, but I told him I wouldn&rsquo;t. What&rsquo;s he
bumping up the stairs in that fashion for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room-door was flung open, and Fred Temple
put on a savage face, for his brother looked after him
more than he liked; when, instead of Temple major,
there appeared a shining big brown satin bonnet, and
an old lady&rsquo;s face under it, who stood there with a
walking-stick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you see I was right, grandmamma; I said
she was not gone,&rdquo; piped a shrill voice behind; and
Mabel Smith, in an old-fashioned black silk frock
and tippet, came into view. They had driven up to
look after Sophie.</p>

<p>Sophie was equal to the occasion. She rose gracefully
and held out both her hands, as though they had
been welcome as is the sun in harvest. The old lady
leaned on her stick, and stared around: the many
faces seemed to confuse her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! I did not know you had a luncheon-party,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just two or three friends who have dropped in,
Mrs. Golding,&rdquo; said Sophie, airily. &ldquo;Let me take
your stick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old lady, who looked like a very amiable old
lady, sat down in the nearest chair, but kept the
stick in her hand. Mabel Smith was regarding everything
with her shrewd eyes and compressing her thin
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Johnny Ludlow, grandmamma; you have
heard me speak of <em>him</em>: I don&rsquo;t know the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, sir,&rdquo; said the old lady, politely
nodding her brown bonnet at me. &ldquo;I hope you are
in good health, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, thank you.&rdquo; For she put it as
a question, and seemed to await an answer. Tod
and the rest, who had risen, began to sit down
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I am sorry to disturb you at luncheon,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the old lady to Mrs. Everty. &ldquo;We came
in to see whether you had gone home or not. I said
you of course had gone; that you wouldn&rsquo;t stay away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
from your husband so long as this; and also because
we had not heard of you for a month past. But Mabel
thought you were here still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am intending to return shortly,&rdquo; said Sophie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well: for I want to send up Mabel. And
I brought in a letter that came to my house this
morning, addressed to you,&rdquo; continued the old lady,
lugging out of her pocket a small collection of articles
before she found the letter. &ldquo;Mabel says it is your
husband&rsquo;s handwriting, ma&rsquo;am; if so, he must be
thinking you are staying with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Sophie, slipping the letter away
unopened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had you not better see what it says?&rdquo; suggested
Mrs. Golding to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all: it can wait. May I offer you some
luncheon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much obleeged, ma&rsquo;am, but I and Mabel took an
early dinner before setting out. And on which day,
Mrs. Everty, do you purpose going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know,&rdquo; said Sophie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can have kept you so long here?&rdquo; continued
the old lady, wonderingly. &ldquo;Mabel said you did not
know any of the inhabitants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have found it of service to my health,&rdquo; replied
Sophie with charming simplicity. &ldquo;Will you take a
glass of sherry, Mrs. Golding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if I do. Just half a glass. Thank
you, sir; not much more than half&rdquo;&mdash;to me, as I
went forward with the glass and decanter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure, sir, it is good of you to be attentive to an old
lady like me. If you had a mind for a brisk walk at
any time, of three miles, or so, and would come over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
to my house, I&rsquo;d make you welcome. Mabel, write
down the address.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I wish you had come while I was there,
Johnny Ludlow,&rdquo; said the girl, giving me the paper.
&ldquo;I like you. You don&rsquo;t say smiling words to people
with your lips and mock at them in your heart, as
some do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I remembered that she had not been asked to take
any wine, and I offered it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>No</em>, thank you,&rdquo; she said with emphasis. &ldquo;None
for me.&rdquo; And it struck me that she refused because
the wine belonged to Sophie.</p>

<p>The old lady, after nodding a farewell around and
shaking hands with Mrs. Everty, stood leaning on her
stick between the doorway and the stairs. &ldquo;My
servant&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; she said, looking back, &ldquo;and these
stairs are steep: would any one be good enough to
help me down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod went forward to give her his arm; and we
heard the fly drive away with her and Mabel. Somehow
the interlude had damped the free go of the
banquet, and we soon prepared to depart also. Sophie
made no attempt to hinder it, but said she should
expect us in to take some tea with her in the evening:
and the lot of us filed out together, some going one
way, some another. I and Fred Temple kept together.</p>

<p>There was a good-natured fellow at Oxford that
term, who had come up from Wales to take his degree,
and had brought his wife with him, a nice kind of
young girl who put me in mind of Anna Whitney.
They had become acquainted with Sophie Chalk, and
liked her; she fascinated both. She meant to do it
too: for the companionship of staid irreproachable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
people like Mr. and Mrs. Ap-Jenkyns, reflected credit
on herself in the eyes of Oxford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought we should have met the Ap-Jenkynses,
at lunch,&rdquo; remarked Temple. &ldquo;What a droll old party
that was with the stick! She puts me in mind of&mdash;I
say, here&rsquo;s another old party!&rdquo; he broke off. &ldquo;Seems
to be a friend of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Cann. She had stopped, evidently
wanting to speak to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just been to put little Nanny Tasson in the
train for London, sir,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I thought you
might like to know it. Her eldest brother, the one
that&rsquo;s settled there, has taken to her. His wife wrote
a nice letter and sent the fare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Mrs. Cann. I hope they&rsquo;ll take good
care of her. Good-afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who the wonder is Nanny Tasson?&rdquo; cried Temple
as we went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a little friendless child. Her brother was
our scout when we first came, and he died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, by Jove, Ludlow! Look there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned at Temple&rsquo;s words. A gig was dashing by
as large as life; Tod in it, driving Sophie Chalk.
Behind it dashed another gig, containing Mr. and Mrs.
Ap-Jenkyns. Fred Temple laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Everty&rsquo;s unmistakably charming,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and we don&rsquo;t know any real harm of her, but if I
were Ap-Jenkyns I should not let my wife be quite
her bosom companion. As to Todhetley, I think he&rsquo;s
a gone calf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whitney came to our room as I got in. He had
been invited to the luncheon by Mrs. Everty, but excused
himself, and she asked Fred Temple in his place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Johnny, how did it go off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, pretty well. Lobster-salad and other good
things. Why did not you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Tod?&rdquo; he rejoined, not answering the
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out on a driving-party. Sophie Chalk and the
Ap-Jenkynses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whitney whistled through the verse of an old song:
&ldquo;Froggy would a-wooing go.&rdquo; &ldquo;I say, Johnny,&rdquo; he
said presently, &ldquo;you had better give Tod a hint to
take care of himself. That thing will go too far if he
does not look out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if Tod would mind me! Give him the hint
yourself, Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said half a word to him this morning after chapel:
he turned on me and accused me of being jealous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We both laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a letter from home yesterday,&rdquo; Bill went on,
&ldquo;ordering me to keep clear of Madam Sophie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Who from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mother. And Miss Deveen, who is staying
with them, put in a postscript.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did they know Sophie Chalk was here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through me. One wet afternoon I wrote a
long epistle to Harry, telling him, amidst other items,
that Sophie Chalk was here, turning some of our
heads, especially Todhetley&rsquo;s. Harry, like a flat, let
Helen get hold of the letter, and she read it aloud, pro
bono publico. There was nothing in it that I might
not have written to Helen herself; but Mr. Harry
won&rsquo;t get another from me in a hurry. Sophie seems
to have fallen to a discount with the mother and Miss
Deveen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>Bill Whitney did not know what I knew&mdash;the true
story of the emeralds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why I did not go to the lunch to-day,
Johnny. Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the scout. He came in to bring in a small
parcel, daintily done up in white paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something for you, sir,&rdquo; he said to me. &ldquo;A boy
has just left it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be for me&mdash;that I know of. It looks like
wedding-cake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open it,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;Perhaps one of the grads has
gone and got married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We opened it together, laughing. A tiny paste-board
box loomed out with a jeweller&rsquo;s name on it;
inside it was a chased gold cross, attached to a slight
gold chain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mistake, Bill. I&rsquo;ll do it up again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod came back in time for dinner. Seeing the
little parcel on the mantelshelf, he asked what it was.
So I told him&mdash;something that the jeweller&rsquo;s shop
must have sent to our room by mistake. Upon that,
he tore the paper open; called the shop people hard
names for sending it into college, and put the box in
his pocket. Which showed that it was for him.</p>

<p>I went to Sophie&rsquo;s in the evening, having promised
her, but not as soon as Tod, for I stayed to finish
some Greek. Whitney went with me, in spite of his
orders from home. The luncheon-party had all
assembled there with the addition of Mr. and Mrs.
Ap-Jenkyns. Sophie sat behind the tea-tray, dispensing
tea; Gaiton handed the plum-cake. She
wore a silken robe of opal tints; white lace fell over
her wrists and bracelets; in her hair, brushed off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
her face, fluttered a butterfly with silver wings; and
on her neck was the chased gold cross that had come
to our rooms a few hours before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tod&rsquo;s just a fool, Johnny,&rdquo; said Whitney in my
ear. &ldquo;Upon my word, I think he is. And she&rsquo;s a
syren!&mdash;and it was at our house he met her first!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After Mr. and Mrs. Ap-Jenkyns left, for she was
tired, they began cards. Sophie was engrossing
Gaiton, and Tod sat down to écarté. He refused at
first, but Richardson drew him on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show Tod the letter I had from home,&rdquo; said
Whitney to me as we went out. &ldquo;What can possess
him to go and buy gold crosses for her? She&rsquo;s
married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gaiton and Richardson buy her things also,
Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know how to spend their money fast
enough. I wouldn&rsquo;t: I know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod and Gaiton came in together soon after I got
in. Gaiton just looked in to say good-night, and
proposed that we should breakfast with him on the
morrow, saying he&rsquo;d ask Whitney also: and then he
went up to his own rooms.</p>

<p>Tod fell into one of his thinking fits. He had work
to do, but he sat staring at the fire, his legs stretched
out. With all his carelessness he had a conscience
and some forethought. I told him Bill Whitney had
had a lecture from home, touching Sophie Chalk, and
I conclude he heard. But he made no sign.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to <em>goodness</em> you wouldn&rsquo;t keep up that tinkling,
Johnny,&rdquo; he said by-and-by, in a tone of irritation.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;tinkling&rdquo; was a bit of quiet harmony. However,
I shut down the piano, and went and sat by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
fire, opposite to him. His brow looked troubled; he
was running his hands through his hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether I could raise some money,
Johnny,&rdquo; he began, after a bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred, or so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to pay a hundred and fifty for
doing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound it, yes! And besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Tod: we should have gone on as
straightly and steadily as need be but for <em>her</em>. As it
is, you are wasting your time and getting out of the
way of work. What&rsquo;s going to be the end of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know myself, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you ever ask yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the use of asking?&rdquo; he returned, after a
pause. &ldquo;If I ask it of myself at night, I forget it by
the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pull up at once, Tod. You&rsquo;d be in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, now: don&rsquo;t know that I shall be much
longer,&rdquo; said Tod candidly. He was in a soft mood
that night; an unusual thing with him. &ldquo;Some
awful complication may come of it: a few writs or
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sophie Chalk can&rsquo;t do you any good, Tod.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has not done me any harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes she has. She has unsettled you from the
work that you came to Oxford to do; and the play in
her rooms has caused you to run into debt that you
don&rsquo;t know how to get out of: it&rsquo;s nearly as much
harm as she can do you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As much as she can do any honest fellow. Tod,
if you were to lapse into crooked paths, you&rsquo;d break
the good old pater&rsquo;s heart. There&rsquo;s nobody in the
world he cares for as he cares for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod sat twitching his whiskers. I could not understand
his mood: all the carelessness and the fierceness
had quite gone out of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the thought of the father that pulls me up,
lad. What a cross-grained world it is! Why should
a bit of pleasure be hedged in with thorns?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t go to bed we shall not be up for
chapel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> can go to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you drive her out, Tod?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does the sun shine?&rdquo; was the lucid answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you with her in that gig to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We only went four miles. Four out and four in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be driving her rather too far some day&mdash;fourteen,
or so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d be driven. With all her
simplicity, she knows how to take care of herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Simplicity! I looked at him; and saw he spoke the
word in good faith. <em>He</em> was simple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has a husband, Tod.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose he would like to see you driving
her abroad?&mdash;and all you fellows in her rooms to the
last minute any of you dare stop out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my affair. It&rsquo;s his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any way, Everty might come down upon the lot
of you some of these fine days, and say things you&rsquo;d
not like. <em>She&rsquo;s</em> to blame. Why, you heard what that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
old lady in the brown bonnet said&mdash;that her husband
must think Sophie was staying with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fire&rsquo;s low, and I&rsquo;m cold,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;Good-night,
Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went into his room, and I to mine.</p>

<p>A few years ago, there appeared a short poem called
&ldquo;Amor Mundi.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> While reading it, I involuntarily
recalled this past experience at Oxford, for it described
a young fellow&rsquo;s setting-out on the downward path,
as Tod did. Two of life&rsquo;s wayfarers start on their
long life journey: the woman first; the man sees and
joins her; then speaks to her.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Oh, where are you going, with your love-locks flowing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the west wind blowing along the narrow track?&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;This downward path is easy, come with me, an it please ye;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We shall escape the up-hill by never turning back.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they two went together in the sunny August weather;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The honey-blooming heather lay to the left and right:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dear she was to dote on, her small feet seemed to float on<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The air, like soft twin-pigeons too sportive to alight.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And so they go forth, these two, on their journey,
revelling in the summer sunshine and giving no heed
to their sliding progress; until he sees something in
the path that startles him. But the syren accounts
for it in some plausible way; it lulls his fear, and
onward they go again. In time he sees something
worse, halts, and asks her again:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s that in the hollow, so pale I quake to follow?&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a thin dead body that waits the Eternal term.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></div></div></div>

<p>The answer effectually arouses him, and he pulls up
in terror, asking her to turn. She answers again, and
he knows his fate.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Turn again, oh my sweetest! Turn again, false and fleetest!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This way, whereof thou weetest, is surely Hell&rsquo;s own track!&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Nay, too late for cost counting, nay too steep for hill-mounting,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This downward path is easy, but there&rsquo;s no turning back.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Shakespeare tells us that there is a tide in the affairs
of man, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune:
omitted, all the voyage of the after life is spent in
shoals and miseries. That will apply to other things
besides fortune. I fully believe that after a young
fellow has set out on the downward path, in almost
all cases there&rsquo;s a chance given him of pulling up
again, if he only is sufficiently wise and firm to
seize upon it. The opportunity was to come for Tod.
He had started; there was no doubt of that; but he
had not got down very far yet and could go backward
almost as easily as forward. Left alone, he would
probably make a sliding run of it, and descend into
the shoals. But the chance for him was at hand.</p>

<p>Our commons and Whitney&rsquo;s went up to Gaiton&rsquo;s
room in the morning, and we breakfasted there.
Lecture that day was at eleven, but I had work to
do beforehand. So had Tod, for the matter of that;
plenty of it. I went down to mine, but Tod stayed
up with the two others.</p>

<p>Bursting into our room, as a fellow does when he is
late for anything, I saw at the open window somebody
that I thought must be Mr. Brandon&rsquo;s ghost. It took
me aback, and for a moment I stood staring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you no greeting for me, Johnny Ludlow?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I was lost in surprise, sir. I am very glad to
see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are!&rdquo; he returned, as if he doubted
my word. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good half-hour that I have waited
here. You&rsquo;ve been at a breakfast-party!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He must have got that from the scout. &ldquo;Not at a
party, sir. Gaiton asked us to take our commons up,
and breakfast with him in his room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Gaiton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is Lord Gaiton. One of the students at
Christchurch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind his being a lord. Is he any good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could not say Gaiton was particularly good, so
passed the question over, and asked Mr. Brandon
when he came to Oxford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got here at mid-day yesterday. How are you
getting on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Been in any rows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Todhetley? How is he getting on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I should have said very well to this; it would
never have done to say very ill, but Tod and Bill
Whitney interrupted the answer. They looked just
as much surprised as I had been. After talking a bit,
Mr. Brandon left, saying he should expect us all three
at the Mitre in the evening when dinner in Hall was
over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the deuce brings him at Oxford?&rdquo; cried Tod.</p>

<p>Whitney laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay a crown he has come
to look after Johnny and his morals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the lot of us,&rdquo; added Tod, pushing his books
about. &ldquo;Look here, you two. I&rsquo;m not obliged to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
bothering to that Mitre in the evening, and I shan&rsquo;t.
You&rsquo;ll be enough without me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do, Tod,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He expects you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if he does? I have an engagement elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Break it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not do anything of the kind. There! Hold
your tongue, Johnny, and push the ink this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod held to that. So when I and Whitney reached
the Mitre after dinner, we said he was unable to get
off a previous engagement, putting the excuse as
politely as we could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said old Brandon, twitching his yellow silk
handkerchief off his head, for he had been asleep
before the fire. &ldquo;Engaged elsewhere, is he! With
the lady I saw him driving out yesterday, I suppose:
a person with blue feathers on her head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This struck us dumb. Bill said nothing, neither
did I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Miss Sophie Chalk, I presume,&rdquo; went on
old Brandon, ringing the bell. &ldquo;Sit down, boys;
we&rsquo;ll have tea up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tea and coffee must have been ordered beforehand,
for they came in at once. Mr. Brandon drank
four cups of tea, and ate a plate of bread-and-butter
and some watercress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tea is my best meal in the day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
young fellows all like coffee best. Don&rsquo;t spare it.
What&rsquo;s that by you, William Whitney?&mdash;anchovy
toast? Cut that pound-cake, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody could say, with all his strict notions, that
Mr. Brandon was not hospitable. He&rsquo;d have ordered
up the Mitre&rsquo;s whole larder had he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>thought we could
eat it. And never another word did he say about
Tod until the things had gone away.</p>

<p>Then he began, quietly at first: he sitting on one
side the fire, I and Bill on the other. Touching gently
on this, alluding to that, our eyes opened in more
senses than one; for we found that he knew all about
Sophie Chalk&rsquo;s sojourn in the town, the attention
she received from the undergraduates, and Tod&rsquo;s
infatuation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Todhetley&rsquo;s object in going there?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amusement, I think, sir,&rdquo; hazarded Bill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he gamble there for amusement too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Where on earth had old Brandon got hold of all
this?</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much has Todhetley lost already?&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;He is in debt, I know. Not for the first
time from the same cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bill stared. He knew nothing of that old episode
in London with the Clement-Pells. I felt my face
flush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tod does not care for playing really, sir. But the
cards are there, and he sees others play and gets
drawn in to join.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what amount has he lost this time, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you know that he is in debt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;yes, sir. Perhaps he is a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, boys,&rdquo; said old Brandon. &ldquo;Believing
that matters were not running in a satisfactory groove
with some of you, I came down to Oxford yesterday
to look about me a bit&mdash;for I don&rsquo;t intend that Johnny
Ludlow shall lapse into bad ways, if I can keep him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
out of them. Todhetley may have made up his mind
to go to the deuce, but he shall not take Johnny with
him. I hear no good report of Todhetley; he neglects
his studies for the sake of a witch, and is in debt over
his head and shoulders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who could have told you that, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never you mind, Johnny Ludlow; I dare say you
know it&rsquo;s pretty true. Now look here&mdash;as I said just
now. I mean to see what I can do towards saving
Todhetley, for the sake of my good old friend, the
Squire, and for his dead mother&rsquo;s sake; and I appeal
to you both to aid me. You can answer my questions
if you will; and you are not children, that you should
make an evasive pretence of ignorance. If I find
matters are too hard for me to cope with, I shall send
for the Squire and Sir John Whitney; their influence
may effect what mine cannot. If I can deal with the
affair successfully, and save Todhetley from himself,
I&rsquo;ll do so, and say nothing about it anywhere. You
understand me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. To begin with, what amount of debt
has Todhetley got into?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed to be a choice of evils: but the least of
them was to speak. Bill honestly said he would tell
in a minute if he knew. I knew little more than he;
only that Tod had been saying the night before he
wished he could raise a hundred pounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred pounds!&rdquo; repeated old Brandon, nodding
his head like a Chinese mandarin. &ldquo;Pretty well,
that, for a first term at Oxford. Well, we&rsquo;ll leave
that for the present, and go to other questions.
What snare and delusion is drawing him on to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
visits to this person, this Sophie Chalk? What does
he purpose? Is it marriage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marriage! Bill and I both looked up at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is married already, sir. Did you not know it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Married already! Who says so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I told him all about it&mdash;as much as I knew&mdash;and
that her husband, Mr. Everty, had been to Oxford
once or twice to see her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a relief,&rdquo; cried Mr. Brandon, drawing
a deep breath, as though a fear of some kind had been
lifted from his mind. And then he fell into a reverie,
his head nodding incessantly, and his yellow handkerchief
in his hand keeping time to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s better in one sense, it&rsquo;s worse in another,&rdquo;
he squeaked. &ldquo;Todhetley&rsquo;s in love with her, I
suppose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something like it, sir,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brainless fools some of you young men can
be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was then on the stroke of nine, when Old
Tom would peal out. Mr. Brandon hurried us away:
he seemed to understand the notions of University
life as well as we did: ordering us to say nothing to
Tod, as he intended to speak to him on the morrow.</p>

<p>And we concluded that he did. Tod came stalking
in during the afternoon in a white rage with
somebody, and I thought it might be with old
Brandon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The time passed. Mr Brandon stayed on at the
Mitre as though he meant to make it his home for
good, and was evidently watching. Tod seemed to
be conscious of it, and to exist in a chronic state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
irritation. Sophie Chalk stayed on also, and Tod was
there more than ever. The affair had got wind somehow&mdash;I
mean Tod&rsquo;s infatuation for her&mdash;and was
talked of in the colleges. Richardson fell ill about
that time: at least, he met with an accident which
confined him to his bed: and the play at Mrs. Everty&rsquo;s
was not much to speak of: I did not go, Mr. Brandon
had interdicted it. Thus the time went on, and
Passion Week was coming in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you running for a wager, Johnny Ludlow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was running down to the river and had nearly
run over Mr. Brandon, who was strolling along with
his hands under his coat-tails. It was Saturday afternoon,
and some of us were going out rowing. Mr.
Brandon came down to see us embark.</p>

<p>As we all stood there, who should loom into sight
but Sophie Chalk. She was leading a little mouse-coloured
dog by a piece of red tape, one that Fred
Temple had given her; and her shining hair was a
sight to be seen in the sunlight; Tod walked by her
with his arms folded. They halted to talk with some
of us for a minute, and then went on, Madam Sophie
giving old Brandon a saucy stare from her wide-open
blue eyes. He had stood as still as a post, giving
never a word to either of them.</p>

<p>That same night, when Tod and I were in our room
alone, Mr. Brandon walked in. It was pretty late,
but Tod was about to depart on his visit to High
Street. As if the entrance of Mr. Brandon had been
the signal for him to bolt, he put on his trencher and
turned to the door. Quick as thought, Mr. Brandon
interposed himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you go out of this room, Joseph Todhetley, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
shall be over my body,&rdquo; cried he, a whole hatful of
authority in his squeaky voice. &ldquo;I have come in to
hold a final conversation with you; and I mean to
do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought an explosion was inevitable, with Tod&rsquo;s
temper. He controlled it, however; and after a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation put off his cap. Mr. Brandon sat
down in the old big chair by the fire; Tod stood on
the other side, his arm on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>In a minute or two, they were going at it kindly.
Old Brandon put Tod&rsquo;s doings before him in the
plainest language he could command; Tod retorted
insolently in his passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have warned you enough against your ways and
against that woman,&rdquo; said Mr. Brandon. &ldquo;I am here
to do it once again, and to bid you for the last time
give up her acquaintanceship. Yes, sir, <em>bid</em> you: I
stand in the light of your unconscious father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do it for my father,&rdquo; cried Tod, in his fury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is leading you into a gulf of&mdash;of brimstone,&rdquo;
fired old Brandon. &ldquo;Day by day you creep down a
step lower into it, sir, like a calf that is being wiled
to the shambles. Once fairly in, you&rsquo;ll be smothered:
the whole world won&rsquo;t be able to pull you out again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod answered with a torrent of words. The chief
burden of them was&mdash;that if he chose to walk into
the brimstone, it was not Mr. Brandon who should
keep him out of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not?&rdquo; retorted Mr. Brandon&mdash;and though he
was very firm and hard, he gave no sign of losing his
temper. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see that. I am in this town to strive
to save you, Joseph Todhetley; and if I can&rsquo;t do it by
easy means, I&rsquo;ll do it by hard ones. I got you out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
one scrape, thanks to Johnny here, and now I&rsquo;m going
to get you out of another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod held his peace. That past obligation was often
on his conscience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to take shame to yourself, sir,&rdquo; continued
old Brandon. &ldquo;You were placed at Oxford
to study, to learn to be a man and a gentleman, to
prepare yourself to fight well the battle of life, not to
waste the talents God has given you, and fritter away
your best days in sin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In sin?&rdquo; retorted Tod, jerking his head fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, in sin. What else do you call it&mdash;this
idleness that you are indulging in? The short space
of time that young men spend at the University must
be used, not abused. Once it has passed, it can never
again be laid hold of. What sort of example are you
setting my ward here, who is as your younger brother?
Stay where you are, Johnny Ludlow. I choose that
you shall be present at this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny need not fret himself that he&rsquo;ll catch
much harm from my iniquities,&rdquo; said Tod with a
sneer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now listen to me, young man,&rdquo; spoke Mr. Brandon.
&ldquo;If you persist in this insane conduct and refuse to
hear reason, I&rsquo;ll keep you out of danger by putting
you in prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod stared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You owe me a hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite conscious of that, sir: and of my inability
hitherto to repay it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For that debt I will shut you up in prison.
Headstrong young idiots like you must be saved from
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>
<p>Tod laughed slightly in his insolence. A defiant,
mocking laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to see you try to shut me up in
prison! You have no power to do it, Mr. Brandon:
you have never proved the debt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Brandon rose, and took a step towards him.
&ldquo;You dare to tell <em>me</em> I cannot do a thing that I say I
will do, Joseph Todhetley! I shall make an affidavit
before a judge in chambers that you are about to leave
the country, and obtain the warrant that will lock you
up. And I say to you that I believe you are going to
leave it, sooner or later; and that Chalk woman with
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an awful lie,&rdquo; cried Tod, his face all ablaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lie or no lie, I believe it. I believe it is what she
will bring you to, unless you are speedily separated
from her. And if there be no other way of saving
you, why, I&rsquo;ll save you by force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod ran his hands through his damp hair: what
with wrath and emotion he was in a fine heat.
Knowing nothing of the law himself, he supposed old
Brandon could do as he said, and it sobered him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am your father&rsquo;s friend, Joseph Todhetley, and
I&rsquo;ll take care of you for his sake if I can. I have
stayed on here, putting myself, as it were, into his
place to save him pain. As his substitute, I have a
right to be heard; ay, and to act. Do you know that
your dead mother was very dear to me? I will tell
you what perhaps I never should have told you but
for this crisis in your life, that her sister was to me
the dearest friend a man can have in this life; she
would have been my wife but that death claimed her.
Your mother was nearly equally dear, and loved me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
to the last. She took my hand in dying, and spoke
of you; of you, her only child. &lsquo;Should it ever be in
your power to shield him from harm or evil, do so,
John,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;do it for my sake.&rsquo; And with
Heaven&rsquo;s help, I will do it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod was moved. The mention of his mother
softened him at all times. Mr. Brandon sat down
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us play at this pitched battle, Joe. Hear
a bit of truth from me, of common sense: can&rsquo;t you
see that I have your interest at heart? There are
two roads that lie before a young man on his setting
out in life, either of which he can take: you can take
either, even yet. The one leads to honour, to
prosperity, to a clear conscience, to a useful career,
to a hale and happy old age&mdash;and, let us hope, to
heaven. The other leads to vice, to discomfort, to
miserable self-torment, to a waste of talent and
energies; in short, to altogether a lost life. Lost, at
any rate, for this world: and&mdash;we&rsquo;ll not speculate
upon what it may be in the other. Are you attending?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod just lifted his eyes in answer. I sat at the
table by my books, silently turning some of their
leaves, ready to drop through the floor with annoyance.
Mr. Brandon resumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have come to the Oxford University to perfect
your education; to acquire self-reliance, experience,
and a tone of good manners; to keep upright ways, to
eschew bad company, and to train yourself to be a
Christian gentleman. Do this, and you will go home
with satisfaction and a sound conscience. In time
you will marry, and rear your children to good, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
be respected of all men. This is the career expected
of you; this is the road you ought to take.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused slightly, and then went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will put the other road before you; the one you
seem so eager to rush upon. Ah, boy! how many a
one, with as hopeful a future before him as you have,
has gone sliding, sliding down unconsciously, never
meaning, poor fellow, to slide too far, and been lost in
the vortex of sin and shame! You are starting on
well for it. Wine, and cards, and betting, and debt;
and a singing mermaid to lure you on! That woman,
with the hard light eyes, and the seductive airs, has
cast her spell upon you. You think her an angel, no
doubt; I say she&rsquo;s more of an angel&rsquo;s opposite&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brandon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are women in the world who will conjure a
man&rsquo;s coat off his back, and his pockets after it,&rdquo; persisted
Mr. Brandon, drowning the interruption. &ldquo;She
is one of them. They are bad to the core. They are;
and they draw a man into all kinds of irretrievable
entanglements. She will draw you: and the end
may be that you&rsquo;d find her saddled on you for good.
Who will care to take your hand in friendship then?
Will you dare to clasp that of honest people, or hold
up your face in the light of day? No: not for very
shame. That&rsquo;s what gambling and evil courses will
bring a man to: and, his self-respect once gone, it&rsquo;s
gone for ever. You will feel that you have raised a
barrier between you and your kind: remembrance
will be a sting, and your days will be spent in one
long cry of too late repentance, &lsquo;Oh, that I had been
wise in time!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are altogether mistaken in her,&rdquo; burst out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
Tod. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no harm in her. She is as particular
as&mdash;as any lady need be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No harm in her!&rdquo; retorted Mr. Brandon. &ldquo;Is
there any good in her? Put it at its best: she induces
you to waste your time and your substance. How
much money has the card-playing and the present-giving
taken out of you, pray? What amount of
debt has it involved you in? More than you know
how to pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod winced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be wise in time, lad, now, without further delay,
and break off this dangerous connection. I know that
in your better moments you must see how fatal it may
become. It is a crisis in your life; it may be its
turning-point; and, as you choose the evil or the good,
so may you be lost or saved in this world and in
eternity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod muttered something about his not deserving to
be judged so harshly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I judge you not harshly yet: I say that evil will
come unless you flee from it,&rdquo; said Mr. Brandon.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care for yourself?&mdash;for your good name?
Is it nothing to you whether you turn out a scamp or
a gentleman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To look at Tod just then, it was a great deal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any reverence for your father?&mdash;for the
memory of your mother? Then you will do a little
violence to your own inclinations, even though it be
hard and difficult&mdash;more difficult than to get a double
first; harder than having the best tooth in your head
drawn&mdash;and take your leave of that lady for ever.
For your own sake, Joe; for your own sake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod was pulling gently at his whiskers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Send all folly to the wind, Joseph Todhetley!
Say to yourself, for God and myself will I strive
henceforth! It only needs a little steady resolution;
and you can call it up if you choose. You shall always
find a friend in me. Write down on a bit of paper
the sums you owe, and I&rsquo;ll give you a cheque to cover
them. Come, shake hands upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very kind, sir,&rdquo; gasped Tod, letting his
hand meet old Brandon&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will let me be kind. Why, lad, you
should have had more spirit than to renew an acquaintanceship
with a false girl; an adventurer, who
has gone about the country stealing jewels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stealing jewels!&rdquo; echoed Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stealing jewels, lad. Did you never know it?
She took Miss Deveen&rsquo;s emeralds at Whitney Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was a mistake,&rdquo; said Tod, cheerfully.
&ldquo;She explained it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mistake, was it! Explained it to you, did she!
When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Oxford: before she had been here above a day
or two. She introduced the subject herself, sir, saying
she supposed I had heard something about it, and
what an absurd piece of business the suspecting her
was; altogether a mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, she&rsquo;s a wily one, Joe,&rdquo; said Mr. Brandon.
&ldquo;Johnny Ludlow could have told you whether it was
a mistake or not. Why, boy, she stole the stones out
of Miss Deveen&rsquo;s own dressing-room, and went up to
London the next day, or the next but one, and pledged
them the same night at a pawnbroker&rsquo;s, in a false
name, and gave a false account of herself. Moreover,
when it was brought home to her, she confessed all
upon her knees to Miss Deveen, and sued for mercy.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>Tod looked from Mr. Brandon to me. At the time
of the discovery, he had had a hint given him of the
fact, with a view of more effectually weaning him from
Sophie Chalk, but not the particulars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, Todhetley,&rdquo; said Mr. Brandon, nodding
his head. &ldquo;You may judge, therefore, whether she is
a nice kind of person for you to be seen beauing about
Oxford streets in the face and eyes of the dons.&rdquo; And
Tod winced again, and bit his lips.</p>

<p>Mr. Brandon rose, taking both Tod&rsquo;s hands in his,
and said a few solemn words in the kindest tone I
had ever heard him speak; wrung his hands, nodded
good-night to me, and was gone. Tod walked about
the room a bit, whistling softly to make a show of
indifference, and looking miserably cut up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is what he said true?&rdquo; he asked me presently,
stopping by the mantelpiece again: &ldquo;about the
emeralds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every word of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why on earth could you not open your
mouth and tell me, Johnny Ludlow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you knew it. I&rsquo;m sure you were told
of it at the time. Had I brought up the matter again
later, you&rsquo;d have been fit to punch me into next week,
Tod.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear the details&mdash;shortly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went over them all; shortly, as he said; but
omitting none. Tod stood in silence, never once interrupting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the Whitneys know of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anna did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anna!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Anna had suspected Sophie from the first.
She saw her steal out of Miss Deveen&rsquo;s room, and saw
her sewing something into her stays at bed-time. But
Anna kept it to herself until discovery had come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod could frown pretty well on ordinary occasions,
but I never saw a frown like the one on his brow as
he listened. And I thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;it was meant
for Sophie Chalk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Whitney, I expect, knows it all now, Tod.
Perhaps Helen also. Old Brandon went over to the
Hall to spend the day, and it was in consequence of
what he heard from Lady Whitney and Miss Deveen
that he came down here to look us up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning <em>me</em>,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;Not us. Use right
words, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did not know, you see, that Sophie Chalk
was married. And they must have noticed that you
cared for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod made no comment. He just leaned against the
shelf in silence. I was stacking my books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Johnny,&rdquo; he quietly said, without any
appearance of resentment; and went into his room.</p>

<p>The next day was Palm Sunday. Tod lay in bed
with a splitting headache, could not lift his head from
the pillow, and his skin was as sallow as an old
gander&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Glad to hear it,&rdquo; said Mr. Brandon, when
I told him; &ldquo;it will give him a quiet day for
reflection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A surprise awaited me that morning, and Mr.
Brandon also. Miss Deveen was at Oxford, with
Helen and Anna Whitney. They had arrived the
evening before, and meant to stay and go up with
Bill and with us. I <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>did not tell Tod: in fact, he
seemed too ill to be spoken to, his head covered
with the bedclothes.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t see many a finer sight than the Broad
Walk presents on the evening of Palm Sunday.
Every one promenades there, from the dean downwards.
Our party went together: Miss Deveen,
Helen, and Anna; Bill, I, and Mr. Brandon.</p>

<p>We were in the middle of the walk; and it was at
its fullest, when Tod came up. He was better, but
looked worn and ill. A flush of surprise came into
his face when he saw who we had with us, and he
shook hands with the ladies nearly in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oxford has not mended your looks, Mr. Todhetley,&rdquo;
said Miss Deveen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have one of my bad headaches to-day,&rdquo; he
answered. &ldquo;I get them now and then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The group of us were turning to walk on, when in
that moment there approached Sophie Chalk. Sophie
in a glistening blue silk, and flowers, and jingling
ornaments, and kid gloves. She was coming up to us
as bold as brass with her fascinating smile, when she
saw Miss Deveen, and stopped short. Miss Deveen
passed on without notice of any kind; Helen really
did not see her; Anna, always gentle and kind, slightly
bowed. Even then Madam Sophie&rsquo;s native impudence
came to her aid. She saw they meant to shun her,
and she nodded and smiled at Tod, and made as
though she would stop him for a chat. He took off
his cap to her, and went on. Anna&rsquo;s delicate face
had flushed, and his own was white enough for its
coffin.</p>

<p>Miss Deveen held Tod&rsquo;s hand in parting. &ldquo;I am so
glad to have met you again,&rdquo; she cordially said; &ldquo;we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
are all glad. We shall see you often, I hope, until we
go up together. And all you young people are coming
to me for a few days in the Easter holidays. Friends
cannot afford too long absences from one another in
this short life. Good-bye; and mind you get rid of
your headache for to-morrow. There; shake hands
with Helen and Anna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did as he was bid. Helen was gay as usual;
Anna rather shy. Her pretty blue eyes glanced up
at Tod&rsquo;s, and he smiled for the first time that day.
Sophie Chalk might have fascinated three parts of his
heart away, but there was a corner in it remaining
for Anna Whitney.</p>

<p>I did not do it intentionally. Going into our room
the next day, a sheet of paper with some writing on
it lay on the table, the ink still wet. Supposing it
was some message just left for me by Tod, I went up
to read it, and caught the full sense of the lines.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="smcap">&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Everty,</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;I have just received your note. I am sorry
that I cannot drive you out to-day&mdash;and fear that I
shall not be able to do so at all. Our friends, who
are staying here, have to receive the best part of my
leisure time.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign3">&ldquo;Faithfully yours,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;J. Todhetley.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>
</div>

<p>And I knew by the contents of the note, by its
very wording even, that the crisis was past, and Tod
saved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Johnny! Perhaps you&rsquo;ll read your
own letters another time. That&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>
<p>He had come out of his room with the envelopes
and sealing-wax.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Tod. I thought it was a
message you had left for me, seeing it lie open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve read it, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, or just as good. My eyes seemed to take it
all in at once; and I am as glad as though I had
had a purse of gold given to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no use trying to fight against a stream,&rdquo;
said he, as he folded the note. &ldquo;And if I had known
the truth about the emeralds, why&mdash;there&rsquo;d have been
no bother at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Putting the emeralds out of the question, she is
not a nice person to know, Tod. And there&rsquo;s no telling
what might have come of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose not. When the two paths, down-hill
and up-hill, cross each other, as Brandon put it, and
the one is pleasant and the other is not, one has to do
a bit of battle with one&rsquo;s self in choosing the right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And something in his face told me that in the intervening
day and nights, he had battled with himself
as few can battle; fought strenuously with the evil,
striven hard for the good, and come out a conqueror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has cost you pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somewhat, Johnny. There are few good things
in the way of duty but what do cost man pain&mdash;as it
seems to me. The world and a safe conscience will
give us back our recompense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And heaven too, Tod.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, lad; and heaven.&rdquo;</p>
